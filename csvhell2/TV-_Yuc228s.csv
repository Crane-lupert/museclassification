I love how she ends the video by leaving the girl to enjoy her night. It leaves everyone wanting more and I think it's very artistically done. Great job Hayley!
This is so gay i love it ooooooh
"THAT FUCKING SMIRK SHE DOES AT 2:57, MY ASS HAS PLUMMETED"
the lesbian icon is back I love my life
Why didn't she go with Hayley at the end 😭😭
"I love this video, but I also have so many questions.\n\nWhy does she go into the telephone booth with a mobile?\n\nWhy is Hayley following a person around it what looks to be a deserted gas station at some early hour in the morning? Where is the rest of humanity? Who is this person? Do they know each other? Are all of Hayley’s friends just hanging around waiting for her? Is there a reason they stopped?\n\nAnd why are there two people standing up whilst the car is moving? What about seat-belts and general safe driving? \n\nActually, why are they all there in the first place? Where is this video shot? Is this all in some other dimension where camera angles are just slightly off and everything is not – quite – right?\n\nAnd why did one of the people jump out of the car, grab their skateboard, and then proceed to just stand there? And why are they all wearing headphones? And what’s up with the matching fabric patches? Are they in some kind of gang?\n\nAnd where did Hayley's headphones go?\n\nAnd why doesn't the person put the roof on their car before they go off? AND WHY ARE THERE BUBBLES? AND WHATS UP WITH THE SMOKE/FOG? AND THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIGHTING?\n\nWhat are the other stores selling? Why is the road all cracked?\n\nWhErE aRe ThEy????????/?/?/?/??????/??/?"

I love the song so much! I replayed the video like 8 times and it's the first time I heard it today!

Lol fuck this gay shit haha remember when katey Perry did I kissed a girl to get to top of the charts why not just focus on the music and stop making sexual orientation a focus point for  views it’s so pathetic
I’m not gay or anything but I would love to have Hayley pin me against a wall and kiss me
