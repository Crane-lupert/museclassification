Here before a mil?
Love you so much😍❤
Missing Avi... So much... His deep voice... 😢😢😢😢
Away In a manager Lol
"Ok, listen. If y'all were REALLY Pentaholics, then you'd be watching Superfruit and would know that Mitch has had a mustache for quite a long time now."
What a nice arrangements. But it was not complete without Bassist
Dafuq its not even christmas yet
"Wonderful arrangement. Sonics are great.  I will say though, Kirstin's outfit is too sexy and provocative for the theme of the song.  Enjoyed Kevin's voice.  Missed Avi.  Looking forward to Matt."
WOW... awesome... i know I was late for d first time. But it was just pure amazingness!!! If that is a word
"Still missing Avi... But can we talk about Kevin though!? 😍 He finally got a solo, and he killed it! (Also I can't wait to hear Matt!)"
i cried upon seeing four people on the thumbnail
"Guys WOW, so simple but soo powerful😱😍 love your music❤️"
amazing but the meat is missing the potatoes ):
casually finds a bath tub in the middle of the woods
Definitely doesn't sound as good without a bass singer 😭😭
im the only one sad to watch the couch empty (with no members just gifts)?
can it please be christmas already
Where was the new bass?
I never thought Scott would sound like a bass. You guys rocked it tho! <3 <3 <3
Everyone has changed a bit. They grew stronger♥
"That's not pentatonix, it is tetratonix, where is avi?"
Don't misunderstand. I love Mitch but I'm not too comfortable with his mustache...\nTHIS WAS WONDERFUL REGARDLESS!
I don't even care that this is a Christmas song in the month of Halloween. This is amazing.
Flawless as always! Such a beautiful rendition of this classic song!!
The 6k who didn't like this I pray for u...for one day you will burn in hell..start worshipping the 1 an only true God...
"I'm going to miss Avi, but it was nice to hear Kevin sing."
I truly love this!!
why avi is not their
I didn't even know Avi left.. still a great song regardless!
"Really hard to see them preform without avi. It's great, just so sad"
Im crying right now😭😭😭😭\nAvi is not there..
always miss them to sing. aww. so cool❤❤
"The tumblr sockpuppet comment police are here, copy/pasting the same thing on every comment that's not Omg mitch <333 Just thought I'd let you know."
Yasss!! Let the Christmas music start rolling in
OMG Kevin's voice is beautiful
mItCh hAs a mUsTaChE?!  DONT GET ME WRONG IM NOT TRYING TO HATE BUT HE LOOKS LIKE MARIO
"I just hope people won't treat the new bass as a replacement for avi, but recognize him as an OFFICIAL PTX SINGER!! (҂⌣̀_⌣́)"
You guys need a bass.
"No, no, it's nOT CHRISTMAS YET"
Mitch rubbing palms just makes it look like he's making evil plans this Christmas 👨🏻👏🏻
Miss Avi's Bass voice. They need to find  someone to replace him.
"not feeling the mustache tho, still love ya c:"
I'm sorry but this mustache needs to go.
the white winter hymnal feels are real hunny and i LOVED IT
You should do a Halloween album next year!
"i know that Avi is gone, but you guys still need a bass."
"I miss Avi, but the song was great, i love your voices, and I love you. Nice video, thanks."
"Guys this is just tooooooo much , that's cool it's my fav 😍😍😍👏👏✌💖💖💖💖💪"
So they sing a Christmas song after Ari leaves? Timing...
"Great video! :D\nBut...\nWith Avi leaving, it seems a little odd for a 4 person group to be called Pentatonix (unless there's plans for him coming back?)\nAlthough, I'd imagine it would be difficult to remarket the group under a different name like Quadratonix haha :P"
Where do I buy the video?
"They are amazing, but I miss Avi :'("
I got chills when I saw the title before I even heard the song😂
What happened to the other member Harpo?
So Appropriate..\nLove you xoxo

Beauty & The Beast Theme?  😂💚💙❤️ that was just for a laugh. LOVE THIS CREATIVITY SO MUCH ❤️ beautifully woven. 
It hasn't even been Halloween yet and PTX are doing Christmas songs. What about acapella Spooky Scary Skeletons??
"I first want to say that I adore the music these kids have produced.  My parents and I are musicians, and they are still active (funny when you ask your 80 year old dad what he is doing, and he cuts you off because Sorry son, I have a gig).  I LOVE these guys, but please, PLEASE consider your wardrobe.  Please do not fall into the line of thought that you must be sexy to be successful.  Please honey.....Cover up?  You are beautiful.  I am sorry if my comments offend anyone.  I just feel this lovely lady has no need to show us anything other than her God-given talent and adorable personality via her voice.  Bless you guys, but I hope to not see this type of costuming again.  <3"
...because cleavage and baby jesus go well together.
Almost a million views in just 1 day! Beautiful song!
Yes can't wait to show my grandma this tomorrow we are both fan she's the one that showed me Pentatonix
This is amazing!!! Good job everyone on Pentatonix with the awesome music!!!
Oh I see that Avi is gone. I guess you could say that Pentatonix DROPPED THE BASS
Pentatonix is my life!!!!!!!!!!!!

I wish these idiots went away from YouTube.
"For those who live under a freaking boulder, Avi is no longer in the group. Yes it's sad but we can't do anything about it. Let us conclude the where's Avi comments. Thank you. Bye."
