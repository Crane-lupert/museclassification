When you're watching Fall Out Boy's Last Of The Real Ones and you get an ad for Pet Shampoo.
The first verse of this song is so beautiful! Love listening to this song
"great song, but i miss old FOB"
Why you won't come to Finland or Estonia? 😭😭
The Last Of The Real Ones
Yes a new song 😄
Anyone notice that this music video almost a perfect parallel to my song know what you did in the dark
"i don't know how many times ive listened to this, i love it so much"
"Flashing Lights, Kanye West it's all I have to say"
"For thoses of you who wonder why he pull away a clean shovel every time, it because they  have already used all their budget for the fake blood in the YoungBloodChronicles"
"in the Phoenix, pete was kidnapped, when is pete gonna stop getting kidnapped?????"
"Carl, I get that you're a crazy sociopath with a history of violence but did you really need to kill Pete?"
3:39 His name is jeff

I so want to make a lyrics video with this song but i'm pretty sure it's gonna get flagged :/
it seems like this album is coming to be pretty colorful musicaly
I thought he was going to dig his own grave .
Stunts By:\nPatrick's Hand\n\nI'm sorry I just love the cast 😂
I've listened to this at least 50 times a day ever since it came out ♥
This is the video were pete comes out as a furry
"I LOVE THIS SONG, HAD IT ON REPEAT FOR DAYS😂😂😭💖💖👏 KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!"
Why are there Wampas in this video?
This video clip reminded me a lot of my song knows what you did in the dark (light em up). Like seriously put that song with this video and it fits perfectly!
who is the man who in the car?
Those credits at the end are hilarious
"Weird video, but awesome song. Once again, well done Fall out Boy. Good shit."
Where do I find the motivation to live? in this song.
"Clip for clip, slide for slide; an exact copy of Kanye West's video for, Flashing Lights.  Replace the girl with Llamas and replace Kanye with Pete.  The song is awesome, just wondering why the video couldn't be more creative.  Still a great song, regardless."
If u are going to slow down the end to read the credits turn off ur sound its creepy
This song is keeping me upright and living
HOLY FUCK I'M LATE BUT THIS IS GOOOOD
How could they kill PETE !!!!
"yo I just realized, that is Pete he's killing. NO! NOT PETE!"
What is it with Fall Out Boy and llamas?
Am I the only one who read the credits😂
If you like this song give me a hell yeah.
Sounds a bit like Soul Punk for me. Especially the bridge. Love it :))
I think I saw one of the llamas whipping
I saw that animal on We Heart It
Oof *see's warning* \nBetter not read the comments
Who remembers when fall out boys music wasn't made using a computer
songs great but the llamas are a little to weird.
Those credits give me life
This feels more FOB than others? I LOVE IT ??
I'm already in love with this album ❤
I like how the Llama hits the car and not Pete
PATRICK'S HAND AND NOT BAD JOE ARE IN THE CREDITS IM CRYING
Brendon... why did you do that? D:
I hope this album leads up to a video of Mikey and Pete getting married k sorry
this is just like that nightmare i had except it didn't had music and mostly fear
"I love u guys so much! you guys saved my life and if u think I'm kidding I'm not, you saved and I'm so thankful.i wouldn't be alive rght now.:)love u!!!!"
I want to point how there has been more bloody fob music vids and Kobe of them had a warning like save rock and roll! There was blood explosions everywhere
How is it possible to be attracted to how a llama walks ?
Am I the only one who got an ad for Sugar We're Goin Down??
Am I the only one who wants to find out who is in the lama suit like I think it is Brendon Urie because of that video but I don't know.. but then who is in the other one??
I actually like this
I'm sorry but 'his name is Jeff' clever...very clever.
I love it! I cant wait till i see them in concert in november. ❤❤❤ i need more merch tho
the piano at the beginning is beautiful
Body removal by his name is jefffffffff
