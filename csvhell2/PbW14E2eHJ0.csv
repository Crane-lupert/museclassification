"*I've watched this video so many times. Not only is the song amazing, but I love how much fun Liam, Zedd, and the crowd are* *having in the video. I wish I was there and I hope one day I'm lucky enough to collab with Zedd. The man is a music genius.* *Hope you like my music.*"
in Liam's jacket says the same thing as Zayn's shirt in the Still got time video\n\n\nLOL......
the start of this video reminds me of cold plays video for a sky full of stars :)
I LITERALLY BROKE THE REPLAY BUTTON
I love you liam. Your energy
People who were there are sooo luckyyy
Liam is the new Justin Timberlake I'm just saying
"AAAA ITS AMAZING SONG ,, LOVE IT !!"
I really want to be there..
This is FUCKIN'bet'r than the O.G VIDEO?YAY!
It's just me or they look like twins? XD
The ad for this vid was dusk till dawn which I love❤️❤️ so I'm letting this ad slide your welcome☺️
I found this on trends
Are zedd & Liam Payne is a brother..?
Liam's jacket says Fear of God
"this is a clever idea, i love liam honestly I am very proud of him, if he walked down the street singing better believe I'm the hype woman and the backup dancer for him and zedd"
https://youtu.be/N1tg3Gz4Tz8 check this video out! :)
OMG I see Zedd on street and I'll die!!!
"Every member of 1D is so talented even they've separated on their own ways, still they create more hit music that we hear today. I wish I could see them collaborating a new song with them 5 ^_^."
Very funny i love it this song
I thought Zedd was a female all these while
"Liam sounds like a mix of Nick Jonas and the old Joe Jonas in this one. You know back when Joe used to end every note with, uh?!"
Hi I Taiwan I very like u song
"Can you do this around the world please, just sing and let people hear you. Would love to see both of you up close performing!"
This reminds me of the “One Thing” music video\n🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃\n*great*
"The song is so sexual, why do they have children in the video"
Love it the video😍😍😍
How can this dork make this not seem sexual as the song sounds? oh yeah its a puppy singing it. 😂😂
"First time hearing this song: ok, is not so bad.\nSecond time: OMG, this song is fucking good.\nThird time: GET UP *dancing around the house* GET UP, HOW COULD I LIVE WITHOUT THIS SONG?"
1:56 how can liam do that XD
This is a sick song with a killer beat....
The blonde dancing behind is really hot
I was thinking the choreography could be more following to beats?? Ok idk
His smile is everything
us: 18 months = one year and 6 months\nthe boys: 18 months = 3 years
Hey check out my music video ;-)X
Starting to slowly like Liam Payne 😁
This was released on my sister's birthday!!!
"Fear of God jacket????????? anyone seen one similar , ZAYN!!!!!!!!!!!!! #ziam  #liam #zayn"
Being a dad aged him real quick but he's still just as adorable
"I noticed, he was wearing the upper with the caption fear of god which zayn also wore in his music video, still got time❤😍"
The girl in the hijab 💙
