"i like it (y) Yes, trully like it"
I'm in love with THIS.  \nI'm gonna need the same wind in this video when me and my boys in ALLISON RED shoot our music videos
Is this still a band? 😂😂💀
"Feel's like strong spirit while i hear danny worsnop screaming again ,good luck Asking you didn't wrong chose a legend to be"
If you commercial band why is so hard write a super hit?? like a pussy its suck
OMG IN LOVE!!!!! AND I'M ONLY MINUTE INTO IT!!!!!!!!! 😍
"But is it take em all back or take him out back? Take him out back is what makes sense to me given the context, and it sound way more badass, but hey, what do I know"
I fucking love this song
Going to be seeing them for a third time on January 15th along with bvb and cte. I can’t wait for this album to drop man. AA is back 🤘
...FINE! It's pretty fucking good. I wasn't expecting that.
I had my worries about Dani coming back but if he able to admit what he did wrong in a song he will slowly get my resptic back
"I love his voice ,great song anyway"
Those boots though... I want some but like the affordable knock off ones because I am a broke ass college guy lol
"I wish it was heavier, it still sounds cool though"
i am waiting for this
Hell Yeah!! That is an AWESOME comeback!!!
How much you guys wanna bet Denis will get back with Make Me Famous just to steal this FIRE. lol that guy's a phony.
"Damn this was great,  pre ordered  yes yes yes. \nThose vocals shine in this."
"Danny <3 i love u so much , georgeous music"
Thank fuck they are back ladies and gentlemen sounding better than ever. Asking Alexandria!!!!
This genre just suits Danny's voice so fucking god holy shit.
He kills all the old versions of themselves. Giving birth to the new AA
I never heard this band but I just found out my favorite band Black Veil Brides are touring with them 2018 so I figured I should educate myself before I see them live.
He's fucking back bitches...and better than ever 😜😏
Put your seatbelt on young man
Don’t listen to them that much but damn I’m hooked I love Danny’s raspy voice
Best AA song in a while 🎸
Love this 
"This is the most all over the fucking place sounding band I've ever heard, they don't know wtf they wanna sound like"
God bless I can listen AA again.
Welcome back Danny. The band just wasn't the same during your time away. I'm loving this song so much and I'm looking forward to the new album. \m/
Hi i'm a new fan what songs of these people should i get to listening to?
wasnt there another dude singing last time? i do not get it
Sure as hell missed this!!!
"well I guess it's true, Asking Alexandria are incapable of making good music. I've been waiting for more good music since Reckless and Relentless but sadly that was their last good album."
"Why do bands sound so good starting hard, then they go soft? Don't give me they are growing crap. Look at All Tha Remains latest."
"I reviewed the song on my channel, check it out."
Dennis had this band on TOP....hope Danny can keep it there
This is a really good soing by asking Alexander so much better to have Danny back in the band can't wait to hear the album
Yessss yes yessss!!!!! 💓

Чет русских в коммент-листе нет\nскажу одно: е боииииии
"I want to start off with i am completely a danny fanboy. All day. But this is fucking perfect, his vocal performance is fantastic. The bands musicianship is fantastic. And those lyrics, i relate to them so much. Danny is king. AA together are gods."
NONE STOP REPEAT. Come for my daily listen.
Does anybody else get the first punisher vibe from this?
R.I.P that mustang and hello Into The Fire
So stoked for the new album thank God Danny is back
"Their guitarists are so uncreative compared to some others in the genre. These guys used to be the shit back in the day, there are so many better bands these days. Maybe they'll prove me wrong when the album comes out, but I can't see it."
Hey Jesus Cristo is  coming soon  wake up Thais is right
remember when everyone was booing Denis for fucking up the bands sound and making it generic? Same thing here. Except that they were never bad 😁
"Now this is something i can dig. Fuckin' hell, that was really heavy... and those vocals fucking incredible! This new AA is something i can rock."
que clase de rapido y furioso es esto :v sta gorda vino con todo
danny <3
Yes Asking Alexandria yes! 😍❤️🔥
Welcome back Danny mate!!! YES! 🤘🏻
#intothefire 9/21
I want Canada
Best comeback Ever !
Perfect ♥️
Welcome back
very awesome)))
Can officially rock out with the c*ck out..  I love Denis but Danny is awesome!  Keep rocking and haters can get high fived to the face with a shovel
I feel like this is the aa I've really been expecting to hear for years now
His voice is so mich more unique than Denis Stoffs. His voice was meant for rock/metal music. Unlike whiny mcgee.
AA
That breakdown... mhh.... so damn good!
Wellcome back Danny!!
"Absolutely one of the best songs they have written. The December can’t come quick enough, this album is going to be amazing"
"Asking Alexandria has awoken, the band resurfaced and is back in the old style but with fresh and new influences\nI'm hyped!\nThe song itself is pure glory, the video has meaning and danny is back!"
danny's voice is top notch these days
Does Ben always stand on the road and look when the car reaches him?
Danny I think it's time you talk to Jesus
Pinche rola excitante
What happened to their old singer? Is this a new guy?
