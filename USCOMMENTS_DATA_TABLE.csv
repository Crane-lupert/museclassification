"7YAAyUFL1GQ","Why is it that listening to this song over and over just make me LOVE it MORE?!?!?"
"7YAAyUFL1GQ","Theory - In the credits there are some sentences that don't really go along with the silly theme of the rest of the credits like: \nTake The Pain and Make It Build Up, \nWhen Your Stitch Comes Loose,  and, \nI Took Too Many Hits Off This Memory.  \n\nCould these be possible future lyrics or song titles?"
"7YAAyUFL1GQ","I love this song but can't they make some music where you're actually hearing their instruments those random guitar riffs and bass and drums? Like I know they have it in them to make more it sounds too computer right now"

"7YAAyUFL1GQ","I'm new here, but I'm fucking triggered because this video literally is the same this as Flashing Lights by Kanye West. I'm assuming it's just a mock/joke because there's llamas üòÇüòÇ but go watch kanyes video and it's literally the same thing.... and why is no one here talking about the similarity??

"7YAAyUFL1GQ","What happened to Fall Out Boy? Where are the punchy guitar riffs? In fact, where are the guitars? I can barely hear them if they exist, just cranking out power chords. What happened to complex drums? What about lyrics that had depth and meant something. Shame good bands have to simplify and change their ways to continue to be popular."
"7YAAyUFL1GQ","I'm crying 'Llamas as llamas '"
"7YAAyUFL1GQ","This music video is just like Kanye West's Flashing Lights"

"F4ELqraXx-U","When I listen to this song at first I was delighted. But I have to say a thing. Lana.  You are a great singer. Probably you are the most qualified singer at the moment. Your songs give an incredible vibe. Your music and art are one of the Best. But you will never get the level of RIDE. RIDE was the Best. This song is very good.... But... Lana the video does not deserve it."

"-Ifnaxi2LQg","Fergie is the shit! The original white girl rapper."
"-Ifnaxi2LQg","This song reminds me about alot of other songs I heard. Not in an unoriginal way."
"-Ifnaxi2LQg","Sorry, I don't like it. What follows this statement is my opinion.\n \n Visually, the video is good but everything else is not meshing well. While Nicki Minaj is an incredible and amazing artist that I DO enjoy, it kind of seems like she was a last minute add-on to try and save this hot mess of a song. Fergie's vocals are ok but ugh, the high pitched This is how we do is annoying. She's much more talented than this.  Lyrically, meh, not impressed. Then we come to the sampling. It's so mismatched and doesn't fit well together. There is no harmony between the two. Music should be flowing regardless of genre and this one doesn't. At least not for me.  All in all, I'd rather not listen to it again and even change the station to avoid doing so. By the way, I love me some Fergie Ferg but this just makes me want to stab a freshly sharpened pencil in both my ears. \n\nSo let the hate and insults begin because I disagree with the rest of the class."

Shakira perdi√≥ ese algo que la hac√≠a √∫nica (de tal modo que se apoya en otros para hacer sus trabajos, a Shakira nunca se le vio tan dependiente de otros artistas, es incapaz de defenderse sola fuera de su sona de comfort), que la hac√≠a especial, perdi√≥ su esencia, se volvi√≥ vulgar, perdi√≥ su inocencia, perdi√≥ ese sentimiento: ¬øHace cu√°nto no llora cantando sus canciones?...

Then you followed in his footsteps.\n\nThey have a word for that and it's 'Tragic'.\n\nI will still listen to your music as a memory as someone lost but never forgotten. *Crawling in my skin* as a wound that will not heal."

And now I lost him, even though he had never been mine. It's time to say goodbye. If he can read these words, I want to say: Babe, I'm sorry for everything that I've done. That's all my fault. For letting you go. Wish you happy with your girl. I'm sorry."

"0501BTnbrxg","Mann, it's very inspiring witnessing NF come up out of nothing like that, NF became an icon to most teenagers including me. It was truly inspiring witnessing the come up, it inspires me as an upcoming rapper to never give up and chase my dream no matter what. I'm a 20 year old rapper and I'm sure you'd enjoy the music on my channel, check me out, I promise you won't be disappointed! P.s....There's no need to hate because I'm advertising, I'm just chasing my dream!"

But am I the only one who did not like the song Wish You Wouldn't, on his therapy session. Idk if I'm the only one, but I just don't really like that song. But, that is literally the only NF song that I have not absolutely loved. I love every single one, including the ones on his moments album. I don't know though, I've tried listening to wish you wouldn't more, but I just can't seem to really like it"

That's parents for you\nVery loyal?\nShoulda had my back, but you put a knife into my hands before\nWhat else should I carry for you?\nI cared for you, but\n\n[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nL-l-let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nI wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nL-l-let you down\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, you don't wanna make this work\nYou just wanna make this worse\nWant me to listen to you\nBut you don't ever hear my words\nYou don't wanna know my hurt yet\nLet me guess, you want an apology, probably\nHow can we keep going at a rate like this?\nWe can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave\nPlease don't come after me\nI just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all\nGo ahead, just drink it off\nBoth know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong\nAin't that what you always do?\nI feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood\nWhat else can I offer you?\nThere's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you\n\n[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nL-l-let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nI wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nL-l-let you down\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, don't talk down to me\nThat's not gonna work now\nPacked all my clothes and I moved out\nI don't even wanna go to your house\nEverytime I sit on that couch\nI feel like you lecture me\nEventually, I bet that we\nCould have made this work\nAnd probably woulda figured things out\nBut I guess I'm a letdown\nBut it's cool, I checked out\nOh, you wanna be friends now?\nOkay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now\nSit around and talk about the good times\nThat didn't even happen\nI mean, why are you laughing?\nMust have missed that joke\nLet me see if I can find a reaction\nNo, but at least you're happy\n\n[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nOh, I let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nAnd I wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nOh, let you down\n\n[Outro]\nI'm sorry\nI'm so sorry now\nI'm sorry\nThat I let you down"

He raps about life and over coming pain. He just so happens to be a Christian and that's how he coped with the pain but I wouldn't say Christian is the theme of his music. Lecrea is a Christian rapper. NF is just a straight up fire spitting, real life rapper."

I'll never forget that one time I bothered my sister just to watch your concert. Ill never forget the memories of me simply enjoying your songs, lying back on my chair while I listen to your albums. Chester, I hope your happier where you are now. And while I don't want to say it, I hope whatever troubled you has been relieved. You were my childhood's greatest singer.

Chester, I will never forget the times I listened to your songs while playing my first games in League of Legends. I'll never forget the times I kept getting scolded for singing your songs out loud. I'll never forget that one time I bothered my sister just to watch your concert. Ill never forget the memories of me simply enjoying your songs, lying back on my chair while I listen to your albums. Chester, I hope your happier where you are now. And while I don't want to say it, I hope whatever troubled you has been relieved. You were my childhood's greatest singer. Rest In Peace.\n\nSincerely,\nR.S"

"SHq2qrFUlGY","shakira, love you so much. But, fue un video muy esperado y es de muy mala calidad...\n\nPienso que tienes que volver para aqui a los Estados Unidos para que vuelvas a tomar o retomar la calidad de sus videos. Barcelona no es un lugar para hacer musica...hacer musica es propio de Miami o NYC...Definitivamente tienes que volver para estas tierras donde te exigen demasiado por la calidad y por la gran competencia que hay en U.S. y cambia de director musical o de videos...\nSabemos que tienes hijos y esposo, y que tu tiempo es mas limitado. Por eso debes entregarte con mas concentracion y calidad en tus proyectos. Te cuento que no puedes darte el lujo de la mediocridad porque hoy en dia te ve el planeta entero y debe haber concordancia con el contenido y con la imagen o video. Acuerdate de esto siempre: Una idea, una imagen, un sentimiento. \nNo hagas las cosas por hacerlas sino por su vocacion natural musical....Tu album tienes unas canciones super bellas, realmente una obra musical como lo son: Amarillo, Nada, Toneladas, Deja Vu, Comme Moi, and when a woman. Pero sus videos deben estar a una altura universal....\n\nTu no tienes derecho a ser superficial o mediocre, Por que? porque el planeta entero espera mas de ti, y te exige mas, y tambien porque de ti dependen miles de ni√±os por alimentar en paises en via de desarrollo.  Y el planeta entero espera un buen disco y un todo fabuloso para el Proximo Mundial....\n\nEscoge y trabaja con los mejores musicos o personas de la musica del mundo, tu te lo mereces....\n\nDeja a Pique con el balon y Tu a la musica, y asi cada uno a sus zapatos= Zapatero a tus zapatos...."

"-jFgNreZPf0","This makes me so happy. The family is together again and they're better than ever."
"-jFgNreZPf0","So everyone is complaining about new Asking Alexandria cause it's different. It's a thing called evolution, if a band releases the same bland metalcore over and over again, everyone gets tired of it. My problem with old Asking Alexandria is in Stand Up and Scream, the drums were sample city, and Danny's vocals were auto tuned to shit. Also the song titles were shit. Reckless and Relentless wasn't bad, but was still kinda meh because Danny's vocals were just really boring to listen to. Also the riffing and writing weren't anything special. From Death to Destiny's mixing was meh, the drums were sample city, but the vocals are amazing and the writing is better. The Black had terrible mixing and terrible writing. This has good writing, well done mixing, great vocals, though the chorus is a little bland with Danny just singing Into The Fire multiple times. Other than that, great song."

"-jFgNreZPf0","Fun song, but why is the video like a sin city promo video"
"-jFgNreZPf0","This song is so fucking good"
"-jFgNreZPf0","'The new album will be heavy' ..... where?"
"-jFgNreZPf0","hate to say it but Denis took the band back to its metalcore roots but this song just sounds like post hardcore. i'd rather just listen to their Debut album instead. its way better anyway. imma go do that right now"

"-jFgNreZPf0","Danny back in the rows = big time"
"-jFgNreZPf0","The AA Family is finally back!!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I think Danny just ruined the sound of AA. Yes. I said Danny, not Denis. Danny made the whole band change it's direction, so he (Danny) would stay in AA."
"-jFgNreZPf0","What is this... asking Taylor swift to the danceia nonesense."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Danny you name Asking Alexandria what it is. Without you there is no Asking Alexandria. Thank you for coming back"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I like the Worsnop voice than Shaforostov voice, Worsnop is better, it's mature than Dennis"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I'll be there in the morning with a smile on my face ass boy"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Not a fan of this type of music, but mad respects to homaging Sin City. like the cinematography is pretty brilliant"

"-jFgNreZPf0","Danny destroyed the band so white Coated Danny had to stop him before he killed himself aswell"
"-jFgNreZPf0","wow didn't realise danny was back man did i miss his voice"
"-jFgNreZPf0","*Any AA's songs that'll be great  for a potential a fan (like myself) because damn, this song is amazing!! I'd only listen to AA once (listened to The Black and wasn't really a fan of it) and didn't bother to do more research on them. But now I really want to get into them! The singer's voice (Danny right?) voice is so unique and powerful that I'm simply blown away by his vocal skills. This song is amazing and raw and I'm glad that It's trending (It's pretty rare when a metal rock/any rock genre trend in the U.S). Anyway, sorry for the long paragraph and hope y'all have a nice day* üòÄüòÄ"

"-jFgNreZPf0","I really knew this single will be so good! Danny is better than ever. They rule the scene and you know it. They grow bigger and bigger everyday. And this is just a song, the whole album will be amazing I think.. welcome back Danny :)"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Welcome back Danny! This video, in my opinion, is about Danny watching himself turn into something he's not. He is hurting everyone around him and he hates himself for it. I like the Sin City vibe. Keep rocking on ü§ò"
"-jFgNreZPf0","damn danny how u gonna leave ben on the floor like that. i'd atleast give him a beer before he goes. damn. selfish much"
"-jFgNreZPf0","This video remind anyone else of Assassins Creed Revelations?"
"-jFgNreZPf0","HOLY FUCKIN SHIT YES!! they have to drop at least one more single cause i cant wait 3 months for the album"
"-jFgNreZPf0","This song is FIREüî•üî•üî•üî•"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Was not expecting this"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I think this music is supposed to show how the band felt after Danny worsnop left just my opinion"

"-jFgNreZPf0","I love it and i love this new path . Sounds clean , lyrics on point danny looking good ;) lol i see a better family stronger band . alot of people have to also understand that screamo is puts a toll om youre voice in fast time . Reason why i didnt start a band because i know it will hurt my voice badly . The way i was looking at this thing with AA is danny needed a break test his voice again on his own try new thing's . At the end their back. What got me pissed is dense walking out i wont lie but i liked the guys voice but i guess he chocked .\nPast is the past time to move forward"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Btw, good to see you Danny.üôÇ"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I listened to this over and over after I first heard it. I‚Äôm fucking addicted. I missed you, Danny omfg welcome back!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","People change. Let that simple fact sink in for a minute. Got it? Okay moving on. If you keep making the same sounding music for years nothing will stand out and I don't know about you but me personally I like to see bands grow and evolve and try new things. I know some are afraid of change and hate it when their favorite bands try something out, I mean, god forbid right? Sarcasm. Sometimes you gotta quit being scared that something new won't be good because you don't know unless you try. These guys are passionate and put everything they've got into their music and I applaud them for doing so. Oh and by the way, you really need to stop comparing Denis and Danny, they both are talented musicians who have left their marks on AA and have given us something worthwhile to listen to."

She used to never show her face, but now she's comfortable being who she is, and she has totally become a force to be reckoned with. Her songs have become number one hits, and she is just a breath of fresh air in a time where music is taking a nose dive. I look forward to every single she releases, because she is truly a remarkable artist, and a great role model to girls and women out there trying to do the same thing."

"-jFgNreZPf0","So glad my dad is back..\nNever thought I‚Äôd ever say that"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Sounded a bit over produced. I guess the live version woukd be better."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Honestly I'm just happy Danny is back"
"-jFgNreZPf0","This could be the album that launches AA into being mainstream, they were already kinda getting there with The Black, but it's clear that they can play stuff that's not metalcore now and they can do it well."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Video summary: Danny comes back and punishes AA for replacing him with Stoff and recodring shitty album"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Holy shit I may have been hard on these guys a bit in the past, but I've always at least liked them and they are hundred times better than any band with the name Veil in it. Fucking hell I might just buy this album so glad Danny is back in this band. He sounds way better now!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Shoulda paid me more now yall are stuck with Dadrock again"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Whats going on with the f***in hair with the drummer? üò´üò´"

"-jFgNreZPf0","I kinda wanna play Twisted Metal now."
"-jFgNreZPf0","The song is good but Danny really impressed me"
"-jFgNreZPf0","WHOAA DANNY IS ACTUALLY BACK?? I NEVER THOUGHT. HOT DAMN. yes!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","This band is getting mature :)"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Danny and Ben should try relationship therapy, running over your partner is a sign of abuse"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I hope every music video for this album is part of a sin city esque story like this is hinting to be with the to be continued...  Better follow through! Sick af!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Holy tits is he back?!?!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","i'm not big on heavy music like this anymore but used to be a huge fan of aa back in the stand up and scream era  but honestly this is such a GOOD FUCKING SONG TO COME BACK TO"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Absolutely love the new song, guys. Do you have any plans on having a deluxe edition CD or bundle for your new album?"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Boys and girls, WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I literally can't stop playing this. I've been playing it on repeat for days!!! I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I'm pretty sure Dennis Stff is LAUGHING"
"-jFgNreZPf0","If I'm getting this correct I feel like this is a description about how over time he started killing his relationships with all his band mates and in turn, he realize he's done this and kills himself in the end. Deep message, well displayed, and I feel like this album is definitely going to tell one hell of a story. Beautiful song."
"-jFgNreZPf0","WHY IS THE INTRO SO GOOD AND WHY DID I JUST GET THE URGE TO LEARN DRUMS BECAUSE THAT DRUM LINE IS SO GOOD AND THE LYRICAL STRUCTURE AND DANNY'S BACK AND THEY ALL LOOK SO FUCKING GOOD IN THAT VIDEO LIKE ACTUALLY WHO FILMED THAT HMU I JUST CANT IT'S GOLD. SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT WENT INTO THIS I CAN TELL."

"-jFgNreZPf0","CANT STOP LISTENING TO THIS"
"-jFgNreZPf0","The King is Back"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Let Denis return because Danny does not have the voice as in 2009"
"-jFgNreZPf0","We're back again, you know we're not f**kin' around.. seems like an apt description of Danny's return."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Not to be mean,i like this song, but the backing vocals sound like the Oompa Loompas in charlie and the chocolate factory, the new one with johnny depp"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I have been waiting so long for this! Must have listened to it a hundred times by now."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Whewww!!!!!! Danny's back!!!! And what a comeback!! Nice to see the AA family back together again mate. Good Luck to you all!!!!!!\n\nWasn't the same without you!!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I wonder if Alexandria is tired of being asked with all these albums."
"-jFgNreZPf0","This sounds like something off thats the spirit by bring me the horizon"
"-jFgNreZPf0","God I'm so happy right now I'm actually in tears!!! They've been through so much and just look at them! I'm so damn proud of all of them!!!!"

"-jFgNreZPf0","Wasn't expecting it to be this good"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Wow, danny really blew me away in this single. After denis i thought AA was gonna go after that same heavy generic sound. But THIS is something totally unexpected. I grew up listening to AA and im ecstatic they are back in full swing. Cannot wait for that album drop!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","How can i download this video ?"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I‚Äôve been listening to you guys for five years and I‚Äôm really excited about the album since Danny is back. AA wasn‚Äôt the same without him <3"

"-jFgNreZPf0","Best asking Alexandra song ever in my opinion.keep up the good work."
"-jFgNreZPf0","You can hear and see the strong emotions in the voice, lyrics and expressions! This song is amazingly beautiful and crazy! Can't wait to hear more from this album. Especially since Danny mentioned,  this album was the scariest moment I felt because I am facing all my problems and demons. This is me wiping my own slate clean. Not exact words but those deep words caught my attention along with thousands of people!"

Let's face it: money IS important and she used her momentum wisely to already  earn some\n\nI just hope she can handle it when to limelight dwindles... careers in showbiz are like waves.\nThey are at a height... receed a bit...you have a pause and then a well planned comeback"

"-jFgNreZPf0","The King is back bitches!!!!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","didn't hate the song I loved it actually. just when he killed Ben? I'm like?? rude"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Finslly sounding WAY better than before! Reminds me of their 2013 stuff that was actually good"
"-jFgNreZPf0","NOT trying to be a hater.  But I wonder how this song sounds live.  AND if he‚Äôll actually scream during the parts where he‚Äôs SUPPOSED to scream.. seen them live 3 times in 2014, and then twice in 2015... Danny doesn‚Äôt scream.. loved their music but man Danny sucks live.."
"-jFgNreZPf0","i find it funny how it says continued in the beginning then cutting to him in the ford he crashes at the ending and to be continued at the ending as if they know we will watch it on repeat"
"-jFgNreZPf0","why doesnt this have like 20 mil views by now? this sounds better than all of FDTD honestly"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I love the new single of We Are Har...\nwait... \nwhat?!\nthis is not WAH...\nIs AA?\ndaaaaamn Danny, you still killing the escense of the band..."
"-jFgNreZPf0","when I first heard this I cried especially the video because from my take its a struggle between his old self and the person he is trying to become and both seem to be leading him to self destruction and only one is going to come out on top or he'll die trying I mean I'm not expert on this kind of stuff just my take."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Honestly think this is a good mix between what Danny wanted to do and the rest of the members of Asking alexandria, it seem that they have come to a new sound which is really good."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Am I the only one who basically screamed when they say Ben on the ground?"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Holy Shit! Welcome back Danny!!! Your vocals are on point! At 2:53 Eargasm... \m/"
"-jFgNreZPf0","God, those screams are like fucking bone chilling. Such power that it resonates tenfold..Welcome back Danny."
"-jFgNreZPf0","I thought a new Sin City movie trailer was out.lol"
"-jFgNreZPf0","c'mon man, why'd you gotta go do ben like that? I don't need that in my life right now"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Glad to see Danny back!!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Finally, Danny is back! this is the real Asking Alexandria."
"-jFgNreZPf0","AA wasn't the same without Danny, sick video boys"
"-jFgNreZPf0","The fire!!!! Ahhhhagg!!!!!! Great!! This sounds pretty good! It's amazing!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","miles away from anything made in that black album!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I can't stop listening to this song. Welcome back Worsnop. üëäüíñ"
"-jFgNreZPf0","This is just everything to me"
"-jFgNreZPf0","waow this video is just"
"-jFgNreZPf0","You can tell they have grown as a band even with Danny doing his solo country music they still got it"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I love this so much"
"-jFgNreZPf0","This is one badass song. AA is better than ever!!! \m/"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Adding it to my playlist ü§ò"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Can't stop listening to this!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I'm sorry, but i don't like the video.\nGranted I've seen a lot of videos on YouTube of car accidents and such of total strangers, but its you guys! You all got me through high school. You're what keeps me sane when in big crowds. You guys make me happy (well, all except Danny. Still hurt dude. But that wound is closing up.) on days i just want to scream, punch and rampage.\nThe song is great. I like it. But the video? I'm sorry, but I'm not happy with it."
"-jFgNreZPf0","It's sounds like we are harlot and a little bit AA"
"-jFgNreZPf0","And oh, Danny got a lot of his hair back after his solo project Lol, good for him."
"-jFgNreZPf0","The Black was a good album. Better than the third but Stand Up and Scream and R&R are better. Danny isn‚Äôt the only member of the band or the jesus christ of metalcore. He‚Äôs good but people need to stop sucking his dick"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Fucking amazing song! Listened to these guys since they started and they have matured so much! So happy the AA family is back together and kicking more ass than ever! Great job guys!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Asking Alexandria, Blood On the Dance Floor, Bring me The Horizon, Falling in Reverse, Pierce The Veil, Escape the Fate, and Black Veil Brides are all trash bands with shitty cringy music."
"-jFgNreZPf0","whoever did the production on this album and video did an amazing job"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Where was this type of song when I needed it??"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I think AA should‚Äôve fought to keep denis, the black album was great, this song is ass"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I want to love this but I can't.."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Love the new direction."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Well there is a god after all! Welcome back Danny"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Songs good but I think Reckless and Relentless is still going to be my fav album from them."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Can't wait for a new album, this song is fire..\nHaha..get it...fire..cuz the song-nevermind"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I love it! The story behind it and everything is amazing! Can't wait for the album to come out!!!!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Damn Good. But its not like that i was expected. I thought it will be hardcore AF. But its too soft inside"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I liked this song!\nCONGRATULATUIONS GUYS!!\nYou did very well,.\nDanny, you have not changed at all, I love your voice. keep it up"
"-jFgNreZPf0","This is way better then that fucking Gossip album Sleeping with Sirens kept hyping up about, Asking Alexandria with Danny is where it's at!!! üñ§"
"-jFgNreZPf0","Why they use guitars? I didn't hear any guitar."
"-jFgNreZPf0","I can't help but feel like seeing a scene from Fast & Furious."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Listened to AA since the final episode had 12k views. Literal hero, and i support this 100% fucking gold."
"-jFgNreZPf0","Apparently the tuning for this song is drop G#. Wtf even is that tuning??"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I think a certain vocalist got inspired by the Sin City movies"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I'VE GOT CHILLS!! My dreams are a reality now and this has made my month!!"
"-jFgNreZPf0","I don't know what to think about James' hair, honestly üòÇ"
"-jFgNreZPf0","The vocals are surprisingly good, everything else is incredibly mediocre. Also whoever mixed this should never touch audio equipment ever again."
"-jFgNreZPf0","So glad Denis is fucking gone. That was a baaaaaad era. I would have much preferred a hiatus (lmao) than that shit tbh"

"1yYV9-KoSUM","to know the self is to forget the self. No organism on this planet has to prove its right to live, none are forced by nature to 'be' anything. Who, lying on their death bed would worry over their 30-year-old body, or their 50-year-old hair? You regret that you did not try things, that you were no loving elnough. Be a wonderer, a lover of life. Be kind to others. Help those you can. The pounds of fat, the unwanted proportions, the make-up, the clothes are nothing compared to the richness of life and its potential for connections, cooperation, and staggering wonder."

"1yYV9-KoSUM","HAPPY PRIDE, LOVE NEEDS NO CURE, PSYCHIATRIST STILL COVERTLY TREATS LGBTQ PEOPLE LIKE THEY ARE SICK, DON'T FALL FOR THEIR LIES AND PSYCH MEDS THAT KEEP YOU FROM GETTING HARD. Gay Pride was born out of a need to celebrate our right to exist without persecution.\n \nHISTORY of how Christians and doctors made gay a mental illness then and now. Until the nineteenth century, same-sex sexual activity unnatural acts, were crimes against nature, called sodomy, or buggery. Sodomy, derived from the biblical tale of Sodom (Genesis 19:1-8). In Europe and America Christians condemn homosexual because of Bible Old Testament law that assigned the death penalty for a man who lies with a male as with a woman. It was against the law. In 1857 Doctor Tardieu said that homosexuals have a form of insanity. German physician Karl Westphal in 1869 published an article saying homosexuality should come under psychiatric care rather than legal prosecution.\n \nPsychiatrist made homosexuality a mental illness. Psychiatrist say they do not treat homosexuality as a mental disorder today but they do. Psychiatrist say they do not treat gays as homosexuals and they make up different names of things that really mean they are treating them as being mentally ill for being gay or LGBTQ. Being gay is still against the law in many places and law enforcement still arrest and convict gay people for being gay. Most people in America are Christians and a large number of them are still anti-gay Christians who are also psychiatrist and psychotherapist who still think LGBTQ people are mentally ill and treat them that way. Psychiatrist give psychotropic drugs to LGBTQ people to make them straight and kill their sex urges. Don‚Äôt be fooled LGBTQ people they are trying to trick you and harm you. Don‚Äôt trust them, doctors lie and make money off of your suffering. LOVE NEEDS NO CURE"

"iKzRIweSBLA","I just replayed this over and over again because my boyfriend said we should have a special song and he suggest this song. Our conversations always lead to discussing our future together and he's always saying he doesn't deserve me. My heart melts every time I hear the second verse. I had never been in love before and then he came into my life and he's making me feel like every girl in a cliche novel. ‚ù§"

"8rhb5wTCero","im shook. SHOOOOK. that scene where everyones in the room. reading or on there phone. i feel so hard. in classes everyones busy and im alone. and i just feel unwanted. man. this mv is so good"
"8rhb5wTCero","Dam that was so beautiful I'm actually crying. With every passing note you could hear all that rich emotion. Well done dodie"
"8rhb5wTCero","Omg... This artist, this song is... beautiful"
"8rhb5wTCero","Super super proud of you and Sammy."
"8rhb5wTCero","Yes. Sammy. So beautiful and perfect. An awesome video for an awesome song."
"8rhb5wTCero","I am crying very fat tears"
"8rhb5wTCero","i was getting so emotional while watching this then i accidentally screamed when i saw melanie"
"8rhb5wTCero","how am I supposed to handle this"
"8rhb5wTCero","What's wrong with being a 6/10? It's 6 more than 0 and higher than what the average bell curve would suggest is average. I think suffering comes from missed expectations. It makes me wonder what value Dodie expects herself to be at."
"8rhb5wTCero","Just watching it to give it views because I've already watched it a million times on the other upload"
"8rhb5wTCero","I'm not crying you are"
"8rhb5wTCero","IM LATE IM LATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT ITS 15 ON TRENDING MATE AHAHAHAH YES DODIE GET IN THERE"
"8rhb5wTCero","I love this music video especially Ellen @Oxtra"
"8rhb5wTCero","Warning: this is gonna grab your soul and completely take control."
"8rhb5wTCero","when the beginning hits I just felt a shiver down my spine"
"8rhb5wTCero","NO SUNSHINE NOOO DON'T CRY BABY NO NO NO AAAAAAAAAA *cries a river*"
"8rhb5wTCero","Beautiful!\nBut was the drink dodie yellow though? üôà"
"8rhb5wTCero","Goosebumps the whole way through... This is a masterpiece"
"8rhb5wTCero","My interpretation of this is that the pain in her shoulders is the weight of carrying something that nobody else can see (‚Äúsomething that is weighing you down‚Äù). When she keeps reaching her arm in the air it‚Äôs almost like she‚Äôs signalling for a taxi which is her trying to escape from whatever is bothering her. Near the end you see all the other girls with pains in their shoulders, showing that everyone has something that‚Äôs getting to them, just because you may not see it on the outside, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not there (like mental illnesses or an abusive relationship). Idk tho"
"8rhb5wTCero","I'm not crying you are"
"8rhb5wTCero","I am in love with this video"
"8rhb5wTCero","So sad... I'm so proud of Dodie though üòä‚ù§"
"8rhb5wTCero","So I think the shoulder touching is an anxiety and stress thing as I tend to touch my shoulder and hug myself when ever I'm anxious and feeling down and out of place thus 6/10.\n6/10 goes as saying that you feel average the plain girl the one that everyone over looks and dies in the background of everyone else's life and this video shows stages of this happening.\nThe girl in the coffee shop who knocks over your drink you then go home complaining calling her the coffee shop girl\nThe slow arm raise in the alley she's trying to reach out and show she's somebody else and this isn't what she wants which leads to looking into the mirror and not feeling the sense of realness (derealization.)\nThen the room of people with what looks like audition sheets. She's thinking it's a good idea because then she can become somebody else that's not herself even for short moments it would feel good.\nThe taxi- Needing to get away because everything's turned black and white and she doesn't know where she is going any more so she goes in a Taxi to somewhere far where she isn't The plain girl."
"8rhb5wTCero","the message was expressed so beautifully i love this"
"8rhb5wTCero","The song is amazing, but is it just me or she looks thinner?"
"8rhb5wTCero","This crushes my heart. It sounds crazy but beauty shines from within. The more you pursue your dreams Dodie, I can't help but feel you become more and more beautiful. That goes for any young girls out there. We all have off days, of course- but you are 100% at your most beautiful when you are doing what you love because it lights you the heck up. Stay strong xxx"
"8rhb5wTCero","this is my everything! so needed this."
"8rhb5wTCero","explain why my shoulder hurts after watching this"
"8rhb5wTCero","These visuals make me feel warm inside. Not a comforting warmth, but rather a sorrowful warmth that swirls in my chest, as though my every emotion has been poured into it and is being boiled into a stew.\n\nIt like it though--this feel of convoluted emotions surfacing and resurfacing.\n\nThank you Dodie, for stirring up some of my emptiness today."
"8rhb5wTCero","If dodie says she's just a 6/10 then i'm mother teresa"
"8rhb5wTCero","I wanted to say something smart but all I can say is... This is a beautiful piece of art."
"8rhb5wTCero","Dodie and Sammy you guys are incredible"
"8rhb5wTCero","I don't know how you can put my feelings into words dodie but you did an amazing job on this. It's both beautiful and heartbreaking. I hate yet love this. Amazing job dodie!"
"8rhb5wTCero","okay but,,, 6/10 for me is like a good day"
"8rhb5wTCero","thIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL I'M IN LOVE"
"8rhb5wTCero","In life, we will always sometimes feel like we are not our true potentials. But we may all forget that potentials are achieved and not easily obtained. But yes ;-; i dont agree that dodie is a 6/10. Shes dodie out of dodie. Shes perfect"
"8rhb5wTCero","i feel like the hand movements represented how she holds back what she really wants to say. she wants to speak out about her problems, but because of how she degrades herself she doesn't allow herself."
"8rhb5wTCero","This is gorgeous and so sad at the same time. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"8rhb5wTCero","DODIE HOW DO YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME CRY IN THE BEST WAY THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL"
"8rhb5wTCero","I love this too much"
"8rhb5wTCero","I didn't realise how much I wanted this video"
"8rhb5wTCero","I think the small shoulder and hand movements are signs of anxiety. Sometimes she begins to dance but then becomes self concoious and  instantly stops to rub her arms or grab her shoulder. Like she wants to do something but just can't. Maybe her doing those little ticks calm her down or ground her. When she goes into the waiting room her anxiety gets the best of her and she thinks that no one wants her there and dodie continues to do her shoulder thing. Little does she know that everyone else in the room and anxiety or whatever the shoulder represents and all of them are going through something similar."
"8rhb5wTCero","I thought the shoulder thing was that they wanted to dance and let out their trueself but afraid to let it out, maybe?"
"8rhb5wTCero","I love everyone discussing this!! I love her art and the conversations they spark!!! I love!!!!!"
"8rhb5wTCero","Well way to make this song even more relatable. Audition waiting rooms are a really weird place of anxiety and low self esteem"
"8rhb5wTCero","This is amazing, I love everything about this video and it is just what I need"
"8rhb5wTCero","this is so deep and meaningful and amazing i can't"
"8rhb5wTCero","This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."
"8rhb5wTCero","This is so beautiful Dodie!"
"8rhb5wTCero","6K comments! Wow! The first time, I could understand what's going on without the sound on. I had it on, but ya know what I mean. The things that stood out first were the underpass, stairwell, hallway. It was the this is a journey moment for me. It ends up not just for the protagonist, but the other women too. Ostrisized or social axiety, body image, getting verbally abused. The verbally abused was clear twice and implied with the cell phone scene. I thought a lot of the gestures were to convey stress and anxiety. An inner monolgue with the I know that you don't want me here part was fantastic. Taking place throughout a day's time was great. As the day went on, things got worse for everyone. This is a fantastic piece! Very well thought out messages! Thank you dodie, for this."
"8rhb5wTCero","I love you with every single ounce of my existence"
"8rhb5wTCero","this is absolutely gorgeous. powerful and resonating."
"8rhb5wTCero","I like the part with Evan's stairs"
"8rhb5wTCero","I think that this perfectly represents everything that the song tries to convey in a stunning yet so sorrowful. Thank you Dodie for yet another piece of emotional art."
"8rhb5wTCero","I saw the pains as being representative of the pain that women face as a result of society. See, one person has it while putting on makeup, one has it while doing taxes. These are all things that stereotypically women ‚Äúare suppose to do‚Äù. This is just my thought.\n\n\nBtw I don‚Äôt think these are ‚Äúwomen jobs‚Äù as ‚Äúwomen jobs‚Äù don‚Äôt exist. I am non binary (born male) and have worn makeup before my transition so I apologise if I offended anyone by talking about what stereotypically ‚Äúwomen have to do‚Äù because it wasn‚Äôt meant to be offensive."
"8rhb5wTCero","2:40 I spot an icklenellierose and good song"
"8rhb5wTCero","How rare is it that a great song is elevated by its music video?"
"8rhb5wTCero","Love this so much <3 Well done dodie, you've done it again"
"8rhb5wTCero","So I watched this last night, and truly I love it. The arm actions honestly remind me of how hard it is to keep calm and yourself when you are having strong feelings of anxiety. As though you‚Äôre trying to suppress an anxiety attack but don‚Äôt know how. So it comes out sometimes. Then when it shows the other girls doing it, I think it‚Äôs to show everyone feels it at some point and everyone is different. Honestly this ties together so well in this video. You‚Äôre amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"8rhb5wTCero","I thought i at some point they were gonna grow wings"
"8rhb5wTCero","No you're an 8/10"

"APHgDFRpCi0","¬°Hola a todos y bienvenidos a mi peque√±o mundo! Estoy harto... Realmente estoy hasta los mism√≠simos!! No s√© vosotros pero yo estoy muy cansado de la m√∫sica que se esta haciendo popular hoy en d√≠a (bueno... ya hace un tiempo). L√≥gicamente con la palabra popular ya quedan exentos el rock, el metal, punk, jazz, blues y todos los tipos que sean del estilo. Con m√∫sica popular me refiero al jodido dubstep, el tecno, la m√∫sica electr√≥nica, el intento de rap, el intento de reaggue y toda esa m√∫sica que representa m√°s caras bonitas que a ella misma... Ah! Y por supuesto no me olvido del repetitivo y asqueroso reggaeton. \n\nRealmente me siento estafado en este juego que representa la vida, en la parte musical claro. Para mi hemos perdido de calle... (aunque no se contra quien jugamos). Solo s√© una cosa... antes lo que se escuchaba era a Freddie Mercury, Bob Marley, Ray Charles... y ahora escuchamos a Kiko Rivera, al Justino Bieber, a varios compositores de reggaeton que nos lo va a conocer ni su madre en unos a√±os, a raperos falsos... De verdad, me gustar√≠a saber que pensar√°n las generaciones futuras de nuestra m√∫sica (seguramente que eramos imb√©ciles...).\n\nPorque decidme vosotros... ¬øQue ha pasado que ahora parece  mejor un conjunto de sonidos que hacen casi explotar nuestro cerebro y tener ataques epil√©pticos a un bonito, excelente, currado solo de guitarra? ¬øPor que preferimos (la mayor√≠a...) unas voces retocadas con el maldito Auto Tune a un verdadero cantante? ¬øPor que hay gente que le gustan esas canciones donde a las mujeres se las trata como animales, como escoria? ¬ø¬ø¬ø¬øQu√© ha pasado????\n\nEn serio, parece que ahora solo triunfan los que encima de una base ponen un mont√≥n de efectos, los que tienen una cara bonita y los hacen famosos por esa raz√≥n o aquellos que hacen el estilo ya sea rap, reaggue... pero no se les ocurre nada mejor que poner letras estilo reggaeton. Co√±o! Si quieres hacer rap, reaggue o cualquier otro tipo de m√∫sica no tienes que ponerle letra como si fuera reggaeton y decir cosas como mis gatitas mamasita... ¬°Realmente no lo soporto!\n\nAsimismo muchas de las canciones de ahora si os fij√°is usas siempre los mismos acordes una y otra vez, ¬øNo hay imaginaci√≥n? Supongo que ya la gastan toda con las letras tan originales... \n\nTambi√©n quiero decir que con este post no quiero decir que no hayan cantantes buenos, claro que si! Simplemente que ahora forman un grupo reducido en contra de todos los otros. Todo por el jodido dinero...\nY vuelvo a decir lo mismo... no es que no haya buenos cantantes y buenas canciones, simplemente que no es lo que gusta ahora, no da moneey!!\n\nAle... ya me he quedado a gusta dando mi opini√≥n...\n\nComo siempre espero que os haya gustado y que nos veamos en el siguiente post!!\n\nPero antes de irme... ¬øQu√© pens√°is vosotros?\n\nChauuu!!\nEdit:\nFuente: http://www.pelibloguista.com/2016/02/la-musica-de-hoy-en-dia-es-pura-mierda.html?m=1"

"8rhb5wTCero","i dont get it :'( someone help"
"8rhb5wTCero","i havent cried like this in a while"
"8rhb5wTCero","i can relate to this song a lot. i know i‚Äôm not the worst person in the world (aka a 1/10) but i also know i‚Äôm definitely not the best person (10/10) people talk to me, people seem to like, i‚Äôm in a lot of sports, i get good grades, what‚Äôs not to love about me? apparently a lot. most days i feel like i‚Äôm just average, i don‚Äôt stand out. people don‚Äôt want to talk to be because i‚Äôm not very interesting. i have plain conversations and dress very bland. my looks aren‚Äôt he best either. the only thing that stands out to me is my height (i‚Äôm 5‚Äô7) im the tallest girl in my class but other than that, i‚Äôm pretty ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or what people would classify as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù some days it‚Äôs fine and some days i want to rip my own head off and scream and people, pleading them to give me a chance and get to know me so they can see i‚Äôm not as boring as i may look. it sucks truely but you can overcome it. change your style, talk to people first, be more confident and soon you‚Äôll feel like a 7/10 at least"
"8rhb5wTCero","this is beautiful thank you for this"
"8rhb5wTCero","Jesus that was good. I love this song so much."
"8rhb5wTCero","if the blue shirts aren't a nice nod to La La Land's auditioning scenes! I love to feel Dodie's passion for that fantastic film. Great Video. Were they surpressing dance or having pain they tried to push down? not sure.. anyone up for discussion?"
"8rhb5wTCero","seeing dodie cry is one of the saddest things i've ever seen"
"8rhb5wTCero","was that a la la land reference with the casting ? all wearing the same color"

"8rhb5wTCero","There are tears in my eyes. This is beautiful"
"8rhb5wTCero","So much love for the music video i can't even. It goes to show that no matter how shitty you feel about yourself, there are so many other people out there who feel the same way you do. You're never truly alone. You're so much more than a 6/10, and a number on a scale can't possibly define you. <333"
"8rhb5wTCero","Oh \nI wasn't crying until she cried"
"8rhb5wTCero","Literally my new favorite song. Coincidentally, I was introduced to dodie the same day I was to ptv. I have weird music tastes."

"8rhb5wTCero","I didn't sleep well yesterday and ended up with a really sore neck that I kept touching all day at school. When I got home, I saw this on trending and screamed at the fact that dodie released a new music video. When I watched, I was really shocked at not only how much of an amazing role model she is for the youth like me, but the fact that she can read minds as well :') I cherish dodie so much and this caring family we are here."
"8rhb5wTCero","liked before i even got to press play"
"8rhb5wTCero","I‚Äôm took me so long to figure out why they were doing the shoulder thing"
"8rhb5wTCero","I didn't think I could relate to something so much"
"8rhb5wTCero","This was a nice slow paced video for a nice slow paced song. Good job Sammy"
"8rhb5wTCero","one thing i really love about art, and that you really often do, is how it can be open to interpretation. different people are going to take different things out of that in different points of their lives, and that's amazing. \nthat's why i hope my creations will one day be opened for other people to see. it must be amazing to see various interpretations of the stuff you create. and to know that people spend time appreciating that and thinking about that like i do with your music and the music videos you make. \nthank you for being such an inspiration. even if you never see this comment, that's fine."
"8rhb5wTCero","I have ASD and am struggling to understand this video.  Why does she look like she has a painful shoulder?  Can someone explain this to me.  Loved the song and video, just my brain isn't working!"
"8rhb5wTCero","SAMMY PAUL YOU GENIUS, i love this mv so much!!!!"
"8rhb5wTCero","damn they gotta check out their shoulders"
"8rhb5wTCero","the whole video here is so well crafted like the choreography and the camera angles and the whole thing is just artistically so well done, dodie, sammy and the whole team should be so fucking proud of this"
"8rhb5wTCero","she is a gift, just a lil slice of hope in this dark world"
"8rhb5wTCero","She is good at showing the truth."
"8rhb5wTCero","Those 500 dislikes are the guys who go their drinks spilled on them \n\n\n\nFAKE ACCOUNTS"

"8rhb5wTCero","I‚Äôm very confused but I somehow understand it enough that I cried."
"8rhb5wTCero","Damn onion ninjas are back at it again"
"8rhb5wTCero","What‚Äôs wrong with everyone‚Äôs shoulder what???"
"8rhb5wTCero","What does the shoulder thing mean, is it symbolism for being hit by anxiety or depression or something?"
"8rhb5wTCero","this is so emotional. i cried."
"8rhb5wTCero","Omgg is she referencing la la land???"
"8rhb5wTCero","i think I'm in love! xxxxx"

"8rhb5wTCero","i have literal chills and have been crying for the past ten minutes, this is exactly how i feel most of the time"
"8rhb5wTCero","This makes me think of Poppy...you know, Poppy's a dancer, just turned sixteen? Because as some have pointed out, the mental illness theme in this video has a sort of contemporary dance feel to it. It just made me think of Pas de Deux in that way."
"8rhb5wTCero","Dodie man your music is so pure and wonderful why are you turning all your stuff into a production"

"8rhb5wTCero","Not trying to rain on anyone's parade but I kind of just don't get this video...

"8rhb5wTCero","Today I auditioned for my school musical, Mary Poppins. It was originally going to be something else but 2 weeks ago it was changed. I've always wanted to be in a school play, but I'd been too nervous to try out. This year I'd gotten it in my head that I was going to be in the school musical, it was my dream and I wasn't going to let my insecurities put it off any longer. So about a month ago I went up to my school's drama teacher and told her that while I can't really sing, I'd really like to get a minor role with minimal singing and she seemed happy to accommodate me. \n\nBut then the musical was switched to Mary Poppins, a movie I'd watched many many times as a child. Now I still thought I couldn't sing, but I really wanted to try so for two weeks I practiced Chim chim Cher-ee I didn't actually think I could land such a huge role as Bert, more realistically I wanted one of the chimney sweeps for Step in Time but I thought why not, I'll practice both and just choose one on the day of the audition. \n\nSo today was the day and I got it in my head that I would sing Chim chim Cher-ee. They called my name and I went into the classroom, away from the buzzing noise of my far more talented classmates. The drama teacher said she knew I didn't want to sing and to just read these lines as best I could. I wanted to say that I'd been practicing a song and I wanted to sing but with 3 teachers glaring at me I was too nervous so I just butchered the lines and left as fast as possible. The second I left, I regretted it. I wanted to sing, I wanted it so much so I decided I would just wait until everyone else had auditioned (so that I didn't interrupt) and go back in to ask if I could sing. And so I waited for about an hour, and at some point my mom had texted me asking how much longer would I be, but I didn't answer because I was worried she would think I was dumb for waiting around. Then my mom walks up to me in the hallway and start asking me why I didn't answer her text and how much longer would it be. I took her off to the side and explained what happened, but it took so long to explain by the time I was done auditions were over. So my mom goes straight into the room where they held auditions and tells the drama teacher but I really wanted to sing embarrassing the crap out of me. The teacher was so sweet about the misunderstanding and gave me a chance, but by this point I was so embarrassed and nervous that I was crying. I try to pull myself together as quickly as possible because I really wanted this. I started singing but because I just been crying I got choked up after the chorus and couldn't (I was really disappointed in myself because my favorite part of that song is the ending). The teachers were really supportive of me singing and had already cast me as a couple minor roles. \n\nI just feel so worthless and dumb because I couldn't to get the part of that song that I thought I was actually kind of good at. As soon as I got home I saw this video had been released, and I have never seen or heard a piece of art that so perfectly reflected how I was currently feeling. Even if the teachers weren't the ones to make me feel like I wasn't good enough, I I feel so dumb that I screwed up not once but twice and I just wish that someone could hear me sing for real."
"8rhb5wTCero","The allusions to La La Land. AAAAAH."

"8rhb5wTCero","Could someone explain the shoulder grabbing part? I feel dumb for not getting it"
"8rhb5wTCero","it literally broke my heart seeing her crying at the end owie"
"8rhb5wTCero","For anyone reading this who feels like a 6/10, I have something to tell you. I am not going to say all that bullshit about how you are worth it and deserving and beautiful and you should not feel like a 6/10 because me saying that won't do anything. There are plenty of other comments in the comments section to tell you that. What I am going to say is that it is okay. It is okay to feel like a 6/10 on certain days as long as you don't make it an everyday thing and make your mind completely believe that you are and will always be a 6/10 because you won't.  It is okay to feel like a 6/10 on some days but you also have to make sure that your mind knows that the real you is a 10/10 and the feeling of feeling 6/10 is just temporary. So don't try to suppress it but also don't let it overpower the real amazing 10/10 you."
"8rhb5wTCero","I love this video but I don‚Äôt get What is wrong with their shoulders and neck the whole time?! Can someone explain?"
"8rhb5wTCero","why was she fideling  with her shoulders tho? I didn't get the refrence. Can someone explain it to me?"
"8rhb5wTCero","Beautiful. We all strive and struggle, love it!"
"8rhb5wTCero","I just wanted the others to go after her. You are not alone. We all feel like that and no one deserves to be made to feel like that. We all feel like that at some point, we all want someone to recognise how we feel and help us; so why don't we? \nVery powerful video"

"8hP6WROycAU","Chester has always been a role model for me and it's crazy that's he's gone now... I'm so proud of him. He inspired me and showed me the way. He was one of the main reasons I started rapping, Thank you Chester. P.s..If you guys got a minute, check out the music on my channel.I promise you won't be disappointed."
"8hP6WROycAU","Im 11 and i love linkin park i grew up with it and i liked it ever since"
"8hP6WROycAU","come on guys lets make this the most watched LP video ever"
"8hP6WROycAU","1:23 how can someone say a sentence like that so smugly snooty into a camera like she was making a duckface selfie. And then this little smile at the end... why even putting her in the video?"
"8hP6WROycAU","Good god. Its still so damn hard knowing that linkin park wont be the same anymore. Trying to listen again tears away at me. üòñ."
"8hP6WROycAU","It's so hard to believe that in one moment it could all end. I grew up with 5 older siblings, all whom were teens during the early 2000's-2010. During this time is when rock music was at its height and everyone knew Linkin Park, Green Day and more. I grew up listening to these bands and songs and honestly, I thank my siblings for that. I always joke around and say that I was destined to be emo because at the age of 8 I knew all the lyrics to Green Day's Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and honestly I'm proud of that. Now, I'm 13 and all my siblings are now adults and I thank them so much for non-stop playing 2000's songs in the car and at home when I was younger and introducing me to some of the greatest music there is out there. Now, I listen to the same bands my siblings did when they where my age and more (MCR, P!ATD, FOB), although I can say they never dug as deep as I did and didn't become obsessed with bands like My Chemical Romance. Being the youngest of 6 of course I was destined to be the odd one and be full on emo as you might say. Of course they think I'm odd for listening to music that's older than me by several years, or to music that screams a lot, but honestly I'm proud of it. In the car when one of these old song comes on I know it and my siblings and I jam out to it together. So once again thanks to my older siblings for showing me the good music."

It is one of the biggest songs ever¬†in the history of¬†Spain's music charts. Plus,¬†Beyonce did Irreplaceable & Beautiful Liar completely in Spanish. She had Shakira on the original Beautiful Liar. Beyonc√© doesn't follow trends,¬† she sets them. J Balvin asked Beyonc√© to be on this song & she did it¬†because her daughter liked the song.¬†Plus, Beyonce¬†wanted to help out with hurricane disaster relief."

"CwLGro-dFWg","I have a theory on how this connects to We Don‚Äôt Talk Anymore and Attention.\n\nThe key words on we don‚Äôt talk anymore are ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt talk anymore like we use to do‚Äù and for attention ‚Äúyou just want attention‚Äùmeaning that the relationships he had with his girls are no longer important here is how this song fits into my theory.\n\nWe don‚Äôt talk anymore is the phase that he and his girls won‚Äôt talk anymore and with attention,he is saying that his girls want attention from other people on how they look or how they would act around Charlie and how long would mean that how long has his girls been doing this and how long they would forget about Charlie making this song fit in with the 2 songs making this song a part 3 to his relationship with his girls"

"D1IBXE2G6zw","So I've had this song on repeat for days, learning it and of course supporting Puerto Rico through the streaming and I think I figured out why this song is so awesome. I mean aside from having all this talent behind it...Lin Manuel-Miranda basically wrote a Sondheim style song. The lyrics are just basically the towns/cities in Puerto Rico but the order in which they are done is an astounding lyrical tongue twister. The sampling from West Side Story is obviously a nod to Sondheim but the rest of the song is done as if Lin was trying to keep the Sondheim theme heavy in the rest of it as well. <3 He did it perfectly and some parts of this song I am determined to learn how to sing just because of how my tongue keeps getting twisted as I try."

"qvXXMsiQBDg","Can I just be the same...let me be the same is like a punch in the gut. I feel like Louis is really struggling and I suspect he has been for a very long time...\nHonestly, despite how much I hate management for the shit they put Louis through and the insecurities they gave him about being the useless one in the band, it's worked out in his favour because they've mostly left him alone to make his own solo music, with all the production power focussed on Harry and Niall. It means his solo stuff has a much more genuine, honest and raw feel to them than any of the others'."
"qvXXMsiQBDg","Louis drops a beautiful song, yet again."

"gOsM-DYAEhY","I'm frankly disappointing in the music video. The intro and middle part had too many ideas crammed together, leaving you wondering what's it about and having you pause the video to figure it out. 2nd thing is why this many special effects? its not enough for it to be good, but not as many as relaxing and normal. Either use a lot like in believer, or not as many like top of the world, where it mainly used props. Last thing, why swimming? it doesn't contain too much action, yet you try to make it contain a lot of it. Deep sea diving/exploring the deep sea would be better in my opinion.  \n\nLove the song tho."

"EUoe7cf0HYw","Oh...kinda disapointed. This song is same as Ready fot it, except that Ready for it was lil bit better. I expected something like Look What You Made Me Do, but this reminds me a bit of 1989. I thought that reputation album is gonna be album, where she'll sing about revenge, rap and some cool beats, like LWYMMD or Ready for it had. LWYMMD is tge best sing so far from her upcomming album and if the other songs will have similiar lyrics about love, like Ready for it or Gorgeous has, I'll be still buying this just because I'm her fan and I wanna hear the whole album, but I won't be excited. And I also hope that this song won't have music video, it would be the waste of time"

"qvXXMsiQBDg","Beautiful Lou‚ù§.... You and your voice both are gift to all the fans from Godüòç We love youüòò"
"qvXXMsiQBDg","THE MEANING OF THE SONG (my opinion) he is rich he is handsome and we all come to the conclusion that he is happy and living a life that we can only dream of. The newspaper articles and photos show how happy he is .Well. Even though it might sound crazy he goes through the same pain the same shit like we do. His problems and pains are nothing but more complicated and huge than ours. Just like us sometimes he wants someone to hold on to . Someone to believe. But I'm pretty sure he can't differenciate the people who loves him and who loves his fame and money. He is infact lonely sometimes. The pressure he going through is unbelievable. His EVRY move is calculated, critized and just a small mistake could end up being a controversy. Louis I'm praying for you. Please don't crack under the pressure. Graphite can turn into diamond under huge huge pressure but it can also crack!!!!so far u did great be the same in the future. When you feel the whole world left you, remember that some dear fans are rooting for you xoxoxoxox"

My parents and I are musicians, and they are still active (funny when you ask your 80 year old dad what he is doing, and he cuts you off because Sorry son, I have a gig).  I LOVE these guys, but please, PLEASE consider your wardrobe.  Please do not fall into the line of thought that you must be sexy to be successful.  Please honey.....Cover up?  You are beautiful.  I am sorry if my comments offend anyone.  I just feel this lovely lady has no need to show us anything other than her God-given talent and adorable personality via her voice.  Bless you guys, but I hope to not see this type of costuming again.  <3"

Where is the rest of humanity? Who is this person? Do they know each other? Are all of Hayley‚Äôs friends just hanging around waiting for her? Is there a reason they stopped?\n\nAnd why are there two people standing up whilst the car is moving? What about seat-belts and general safe driving? \n\nActually, why are they all there in the first place? Where is this video shot? Is this all in some other dimension where camera angles are just slightly off and everything is not ‚Äì quite ‚Äì right?\n\nAnd why did one of the people jump out of the car, grab their skateboard, and then proceed to just stand there? And why are they all wearing headphones? And what‚Äôs up with the matching fabric patches? Are they in some kind of gang?\n\nAnd where did Hayley's headphones go?\n\nAnd why doesn't the person put the roof on their car before they go off? AND WHY ARE THERE BUBBLES? AND WHATS UP WITH THE SMOKE/FOG? AND THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIGHTING?\n\nWhat are the other stores selling? Why is the road all cracked?\n\nWhErE aRe ThEy????????/?/?/?/??????/??/?"
