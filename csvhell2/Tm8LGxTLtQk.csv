who the fu*ck disliked this!
"I understand what he was going through this... You just lost the very purpose on continue living. Every morning you wake up, your mind tells aahhh... just another day. Every evening before you fell asleep you wish that you will never wake up tomorrow. It's like there is no meaning in continue living anymore. And you will come to a point that you just want it to be done. And that's it."
"Why would people hate this,that's actually sad"
"Let's try to get Linkin Park to 10 million subscribers, c'mon guys we can do this.!"
Your light will always Shine in our hearts
your light will never go out chester. thank you for everything. may you continue and always rest in peace. 💐💓
This has to be extremely hard to make...thank you all...❤️
Chester will always live in our hearts
Your light will never go out. It's inside of each of our hearts. ❤❤

i'm crying...Chester come back
I miss you so fucking much...my heart is broken...i want to cry so freaking hard...😔
that was hard to watch
Fuck everyone who thumbs down this song
"a band where everyone is the key to an extraordinary success, where a tragic event leaves everyone without a reaction, without an understanding pq? .... we listen to lp all day, waiting for shows, music, videos, and on a certain morning we wake up with the news that an idol is gone ...... even after this time that I pass, still hurts and remembers the memory of how linkim park was special for many, but that will always be alive in our memories"
His voice never died in my heart :')
I heard this song yesterday for the first time whilst I was at work. It took all my willpower to hold back my tears in front of a whole restaurant full of people. It is the saddest yet most beautiful song I have ever heard. Fuck depression. RIP Chester.
Can we not cut onions here please...?
This is one of the softest LP song ever!\n#RIPChester
