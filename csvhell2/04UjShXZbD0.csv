If there was a movie about insane people this should be the song for the movie
"*Mad Hatter (LYRICS)*\n\nMy friends don't walk, they run\nSkinny dip in rabbit holes for fun\nPopping, popping balloons with guns, getting high off helium\nWe paint white roses red\nEach shade from a different person's head\nThis dream, dream is a killer\nGetting drunk with the blue caterpillar\n \nI'm peeling the skin off my face\n'Cause I really hate being safe\nThe normals, they make me afraid\nThe crazies, they make me feel sane\n\nI'm nuts, baby, I'm mad\nThe craziest friend that you've ever had\nYou think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone\nTell the psychiatrist something is wrong\nOver the bend, entirely bonkers\nYou like me best when I'm off my rocker\nTell you a secret, I'm not alarmed\nSo what if I'm crazy? The best people are\nAll the best people are crazy, all the best people are\n\nWhere is my prescription?\nDoctor, doctor please listen\nMy brain is scattered\nYou can be Alice, I'll be the mad hatter\n\nI'm peeling the skin off my face\n'Cause I really hate being safe\nThe normals, they make me afraid\nThe crazies, they make me feel sane\n\nI'm nuts, baby, I'm mad,\nThe craziest friend that you've ever had\nYou think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone\nTell the psychiatrist something is wrong\nOver the bend, entirely bonkers\nYou like me best when I'm off my rocker\nTell you a secret, I'm not alarmed\nSo what if I'm crazy? The best people are\n\nYou think I'm crazy, you think I'm gone\nSo what if I'm crazy? All the best people are\nAnd I think you're crazy too, I know you're gone\nThat's probably the reason that we get along\n\nI'm nuts, baby, I'm mad,\nThe craziest friend that you've ever had\nYou think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone\nTell the psychiatrist something is wrong\nOver the bend, entirely bonkers\nYou like me best when I'm off my rocker\nTell you a secret, I'm not alarmed\nSo what if I'm crazy? The best people are\nAll the best people are crazy, all the best people are\nAll the best people are crazy, all the best people are\n\n*Hope you used the lyrics from me. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY*"
