"he's so skinny now. proud of him, and it looks very good on him. he's handsome now"
Too good to listen and feel the inner message it gives. <3
I'm falling in love with this song💓
I just covered this beautiful song. It's my first cover and it would mean a lot if you listen it on my channel and support me. Thank you.
"so legend..\nmost singer attract people with MV, digital voice, etc. but Sam Smith always impressed us even only with his pure voice. I want to see him sing with adele.. she is my favorite singer too"
Does he work out..?

Sam awesome smith! You guys should check out John Saga's version of this!

"God gifted you a incredible voice. So dont waste it. Btw, i love this song.😊"
THE VOICE IN ORIGINAL AND THIS LIVE SHOW IS SAME  U ARE MOTHERFUCKING LEGENDARY SINGER WHO CAN HAVE A OWN ORIGINALITY SAM SMITH U HAVE THE TROPHIE ! :) <3
I wish to sing this song at church if it was a Gospel song
Sam has a warmth and inviting feeling in his songs. It's very likable.
OMG. I didn't notice this before. Why are the black people on one side and the white people on the other? Segregation in a single music video...disgraceful.
"I just stare how he could lost weight and I can say, that I loved him much more when he was fat :D"
Can't wait for an album
"Lyrics=Cause every time you hurt me,the less that i cry\n\nMe=Cause every time you hurt me,the list that i buy...."
