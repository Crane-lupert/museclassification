"Damn, this is real, i love it so much"
Can someone please teach this guy how to drink water?
I wait how high 2
How can hip hop die if Wu Tang is forever?
This what I'm talking bout
Need a remix/part II with the missing members....
i don't see why i can't appreciate this and what yall old mfs call mumble rap yall corny
They dropped a song? Fucking hell! 🔥🔥
"for fuck sakes WU, just Add REDMAN to the roster SMFH!"
"This does sound like old WU,  they still got it.  Missing a few members on this though"
Man i miss odb he the missing piece r.i.p bro
"online gangstas gonna give em screen shots, HAHAHAHAHASHAH what a fucking great line"
On everything.. One of these guys did nas rap scheme..
God Bless Wu Tang! Check out my music ✊ much love
Godddddddddddddd daymmmm This some real hip hop right here!!!
who's the dude singing?
"I hope these new niggaz is takin notes. Wu is still a problem,and they making sure no one ever forgets it"
"all trap artists, suck my big baaallsssssssss, this is the real music"
WU-TANG is for the children.
I haven't listened to hip hop/rap since all this new lonzo ball type bullshit  started coming out and I had no idea it was called mumble rap😂 so fucking true its so stupid the music we have now.please Wu-Tang bring them raw beats and lyrics back
"No offence to Reggie, but why Wu got to have any guest collabo on lyrics ? They got 8 members, 9 if you wanna count Cappa, where Gza @ ? Where U God @ ? Where Ghost @ ?   The first 2 albums lead singles were Protect Ya Neck and Triumph. Also, RZA need to come better with production, this is good but it ain't classic, genre changing, like the first 2 albums...THINK WU NEED SOME DARINGER PRODUCTION..."
That's pretty fucking cool
Who fucking disliked this???? Must of been all the new rappers!!! This the real shit
my bars are nutty that payday that just fire
Old school hip hop feel.
Feels good to be back
Wow love this hope they making another album
"Hi All, The flow and wordplay of People Say is unbelievable!  This has to be best rap song to date in 2017--in fact, it's one of the best pieces of hip hop poetry I have heard in a while--and Redman's verse shows that his skills are still as sharp as when he first began his rap career!  Take care, QP"
The beat is too clean. I like it
I actually like the song more after watching the video.
Red Man fits in perfect with the Wu !!!!!!!!
You can't stop to watch \nSuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Wish I could hear that crazy guitar wu tang /Redman track from the unreleased album.  💣💣💥💥💥
Sound cloud rappers wouldn't know what to think of this shit. This that hip hop I miss! W's up!!!
I came when they dropped it und my dick is still dripping cum...
Can I get a Wuuuuuuu Tang!!      -ODB
"wutang clan forever.  no we dont die, we just multiply forever and ever"
Wish people would listen to this instead of lil pump trash
"That Mariners jersey is fire, shout out all the Seattle homies"
"They may look old, but the realist hip hop never dies! Thank god for this!"
Timeless...What else needs to be said gawd...
This album gonna be 🔥
Where can I get that Shaolin hat
This won’t get noticed because people don’t respect real shit no more.
Here since last year
Wu-tang's for the children!!!
"Only 1.2 Mil hits as of 10/9/2017???!! If this was some of that young boy trash mumble rap we would be at 703Mil already. Cmon old heads, cop the realness!!! TO 2 MILLION!!!"
