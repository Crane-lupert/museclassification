Love it so much ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Old song but new mv
This is just sick
"Falling too fast to prepare for this\nTripping in the world could be dangerous\nEverybody circling is vulturous\nNegative, nepotist\n\nEverybody waiting for the fall of man\nEverybody praying for the end of times\nEverybody hoping they could be the one\nI was born to run, I was born for this\n\nWhip, whip\nRun me like a racehorse\nPull me like a ripcord\nBreak me down and build me up\nI wanna be the slip, slip\nWord upon your lip, lip\nLetter that you rip, rip\nBreak me down and build me up\n\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do whatever it takes\nCause I love how it feels when I break the chains\nWhatever it takes\nYeah take me to the top I'm ready for\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do what it takes\n\nAlways had a fear of being typical\nLooking at my body feeling miserable\nAlways hanging on to the visual\nI wanna be invisible\n\nLooking at my years like a martyrdom\nEverybody needs to be a part of them\nNever be enough, I'm the prodigal son\nI was born to run, I was born for this\n\nWhip, whip\nRun me like a racehorse\nPull me like a ripcord\nBreak me down and build me up\nI wanna be the slip, slip\nWord upon your lip, lip\nLetter that you rip, rip\nBreak me down and build me up\n\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do whatever it takes\nCause I love how it feels when I break the chains\nWhatever it takes\nYeah take me to the top, I'm ready for\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do what it takes\n\nHypocritical, egotistical\nDon't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical\nWorking hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box\nAn epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost\nI'm an apostrophe\nI'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see\nI'm just a product of the system of catastrophe\nAnd yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased\nAnd when I am deceased\nAt least I'll go down to the grave and die happily\nAnd leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee\nI do what it takes\n\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do whatever it takes\nCause I love how it feels when I break the chains\nWhatever it takes\nYeah take me to the top, I'm ready for\nWhatever it takes\nCause I love the adrenaline in my veins\nI do what it takes"
Can I get some subs
Well damn! I‚Äôve been waited for this for 3 months and now finally its here. #WWEBattleground
"Believer , thunder , demons and this"
Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs taken me a week to watch this. I feel ashamed
Damm....They just can't make a bad song
I love Imagine Dragons. üòä They the best. üòä always motavating.
"Is it me, but their songs have hidden associated with the name of their group"
listen to our music and subscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54hE4YlQVImZ8BnPdhz8BQ?view_as=subscriber
This song is just great
"I realize in here, that the vokalis pro rapper üòç"
I would love to know how they made the music video
"With all their songs blowing up, hopefully fame won‚Äôt get to their heads and change their music."
Why is no one here from WWE battleground :(
Your music always helps clear my mind and get me hyped up thanks for that
Wonder why there's triple routine
You made it Scotland!
Second favorite band <3 anyone else here fobsessed? Hint only Fall Out Boy fans will say yes xD
I really liked it
from Vietnam with love <3<3<3
Does anyone else think of the music video Take my picture by Filter?
"Imagine GARBAGE! Oh wait, there's no need to imagine, you have these guys to remind you garbage exists!"
the best band around at the moment
This him sayin he sell his soul.
the chorus is my least favorite part of the song lol
Still listening to this song after russ won MVP!! #THUNDERUP
I have a song about this! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EO-9Su8VCdc <‚Äî click this for whatever it takes x2
whatever it takes i will listen till i die
Great song I watched this six times now love it üòç
I wanna be like this dude when I grow up.
This is what a true artist looks like.
is it like a scene from a Titanic?
this is a FANTASTIC SONG OMFG!!!!!!!!
He looks so damn good in this video üòçüòçüòô
I LOVE U IMAGINE DRAGONSüôÉüôÉüòÅ
I personally hate this one! I wish they'd go back to the same kind of songs as Demons and Radioactive!
"I‚Äôm ready already for their next album. If y‚Äôall can get on that quick. K, thanks. ü§ó"
thankfully none of them were wearing jeans! That would be torturous! XD
Finally this song is getting popular
"And once again, they make an amazing track."
This is my favorite song from the whole albumüòç
Directors: We're going to destroy TWO sets of instruments?\nImagine Dragons: WHATEVER IT TAKES....
"I'm frankly disappointing in the music video. The intro and middle part had too many ideas crammed together, leaving you wondering what's it about and having you pause the video to figure it out. 2nd thing is why this many special effects? its not enough for it to be good, but not as many as relaxing and normal. Either use a lot like in believer, or not as many like top of the world, where it mainly used props. Last thing, why swimming? it doesn't contain too much action, yet you try to make it contain a lot of it. Deep sea diving/exploring the deep sea would be better in my opinion.  \n\nLove the song tho."
Man i hate it when random people start pulling and pushing me when i'm trying to sing underwater
A NEW SONG FROM THE BEST BAND
imagine dragons is the next thing closest to twentyonepilots.... literally i dont feel like i need any other music apart from twentyonepilots n imagine dragons ......i may be biased bcoz i luv ALTERNATIVE music... well thats just me
Not even getting close to despacito
"This is the best band I've never heard of. Heard one of their songs on the radio and being a curious person, I looked them up and discovered this new world. Love the rythym and flow to their songs, also how it seems like power music in the sense it's uplifting and builds the hope within."
Imagine Dragons you‚Äôve done it again
When you wanna fuck you do whatever it takes üòÇ
This made my day
This song is fireüî•üî•:D
Hello to anyone reading this! It would mean the world to me if you could just spare 2 minutes of your spare time to check out my guitar cover of this song over on my channel. I put a ridiculous amount of time and effort in to my music. Promise you won't be disappointed!
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE SEE YOU GUYS LIVE IN CONCERT IN FLORIDA I love your songs and you are my FAVORITE bandüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ\nGreyson Peugh
