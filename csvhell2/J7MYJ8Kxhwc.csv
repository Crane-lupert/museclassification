*Hi I'm Nate have we met before* love that part
I was just about to study but then...... I don't care NF  buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*
you know when like your favourite actor dies and you see someone new on a small show come along and you're like omg its like that guy is going to be the new ***** in 10 years time. well....think i found eminem for my kids generation.
Hey guys I'm 13 and trying to make it pls sub to my channel i rap https://youtu.be/1Kaiov-2IDM
So proud of this guy!
"Awesome, thanks for the music"
this is a great transitional track first verse is alot of his new style then the chorus hits you with some classic nf feel
"NF: lights off and I write songs--Me: lights off and I...listen to your music. At 12:48a in the middle of school week. Yop, that's what I do."
Still not better than King Los..... next
"This is only the beginning for nate, I'm gettin' an eminem vibe and I love it. Not comparing or anything, huge fan of both !!"
Nice symbolism. It's deep and true!
I can relate to this song and my life no where anyone wants to see me feels like no friends no body their to catch u if u fall but a block of cement
"this is how rap should be, not having to curse every other worn, not having to brag about girls, money or cars.  NF knows what he's doing"
"I'm a outcast , isn't that funny."
And he did it again! So good!
"#♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  #♥♥♥♥\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n*This Is True Love!!!  (Just ask Him)*"
Does anyone else think of Nico di Angelo like when he was still insecure about anything? No? Okay just me
This song is the only one that gets me... people only talk to me for answers on homework. I am an outcast
My math teacher plays this song. Love you Mr. Mac
Man in these comments I see a lot of people promoting themselves saying I would really appreciate it if u check out my music/channel
Llike this song and hes good. Why does he sound like eminem.
"be quiet everyone NF gots this he ain't gotta lose faith to make it, just watch he gon' be bigger than them all, and that includes eminem, and why do people compare him to eminem they sound nothing alike, they don't even look alike, so why, is it cause he's white, or is it just because a white rapper is becoming famous that he has to be compared to eminem, I don't know I think NF is Nathan John Feuerstein (I think that's how to spell his last name)."
"love how this dude is making a name for himself without features, REAL music"
lyricly my favorite rapper out has meaning to all his songs I can greatly relate to his music 💣💣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"0:51 \nWell Russ, that's what happens when you offend Nate 😂😂"
1 M I L L I O N ! !
Listen to my new song click on my profile or my soundcloud is RealDProductions if you wanna listen to something different
I relate to and appreciate his music.
Can anyone else respect the fact that he's not riding on a Lambo?
Why do I feel like here soon he is gonna drop a song called perception?
"God. Sorry NF I love u more than any god in any religion. At least, you are honest, and friendly"
I've been here since 2k subs
He sounds a lot like eminem. He's an amazing rapper! God Bless you man!
He just keeps getting better and better
When a Christian rapper is taking the rap game by storm over all the other mumble fuckers
If u down this u don't like real music. What's wrong with yall
"After this album the music industry won't ignore this guy anymore. NF puts so much of himself in his music it's amazing, you can't listen to any of his songs and not feel or relate emotionally. This is one reason he's blowing up, he taps into the emotions of his fans because everybody can relate to his pains and struggle in some way and plus he's very talented at what he does,"
Caution tape like intro 1.... who else remembers the penguin walk 😂😂😂if not rewatch intro one video
who else is watching this over and over?
For the 1k people didn't like this has no taste in music💯💯 this sh.ts fire🔥🔥🔥
Who else waiting for NF to release the movie
1000 people accidentally hit the Dislike button.
R⃣E⃣A⃣L⃣ M⃣U⃣S⃣I⃣C⃣🙌🏼
sipan
It would be the most epic thing of all time if you collaborated with Eminem! It would also get you many more followers as not many people know of you yet!
I'm sick of people telling me to smile more Roman?
Perfectly shows how I feel rn
i think NF is much better than Eminem
I like how he puts the joker smile on his face in black and how he let's like 4 people in the cage with him to take a picture
Channel with great hip hop songs : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyoR75CMPsrCn_LkWMIJnSQ/videos
This is the type of song you rap along to and keep on replay ‼
Anyone else notice that the end of outro and this masterpiece are connected
"Nice song once again! I like how so many people can relate to this music, because a lot of people have felt like outcasts in their lives"
At first I thought it was Eminem
He want to be eminem...
NF is by far the most emotional and lyrical rapper I've ever heard
Dude. Im still waiting for the somg that explains NF chair beef. \n\n\nWhat did they do to you Nate? (Joking aside iv probably looped this song since release)
Best rapper of all time. His music helps me through a lot of issues in life! Thank god for him making music. Every song he has ever made is amazing! No other rapper stands close to his talent! #SorryEminem
cool and need a lyric
Who think he got that Eminem flow like up
What's studying when NF is life? 💯🖤👌🏽🔥
"weakest album,  previous was on the level higer, but this song with video make strong effect"
he said goose bumps through the whole track and i have goosebumps rn
NF you should make a video with \nthis is me tv
NF you should make a video with \nthis is me tv
Every rapper right now is looking up who's hiring
"1 million views in 6 days, my man is finally gaining some ground, keep killing it NF!"
"The people who hate on NF's music can't handle the truth. NF is real, some people can't comprehend that."
Nf If is such an underrated artist he deserves to be at the top of the charts. I have never loved an artist more than him😩 I realate so much ugh so glad the new album is out he is doing so great 😍😭
I'm an outcast in my own Church and Christians. So wat that make me?
