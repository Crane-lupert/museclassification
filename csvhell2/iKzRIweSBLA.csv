"When you were going to dance to this song at hoco with your beautiful girlfriend, but she breaks up with you and now you're left in tears at 1 am..."
"super song I loved it, would learn and sing for my girlfriend."
"1:03 baby okay, but why did I think of baby shark doo doo lol 😂"
Listening this with your *the one* is just meant to be.
i love this song very much.....
Thankyou ed for make this song.. Such a perfect song :)
This song is so sweet and simple. Only a man who has gone through real love and hunger can think of such lyrics. And I hope he doesn't release a stupid video to destroy the song.
I just replayed this over and over again because my boyfriend said we should have a special song and he suggest this song. Our conversations always lead to discussing our future together and he's always saying he doesn't deserve me. My heart melts every time I hear the second verse. I had never been in love before and then he came into my life and he's making me feel like every girl in a cliche novel. ❤
who put onion here..\ni'll kick you right in the ass..
It disgusted me when the toothbrushes touched each other 😂
But. But there were no onions in the video 😐 so why am i 😒 nvm
Song is also perfect
my man told me he has fall in love with me since i was 16 & he is 15 that time & i really didn't notice that until i turned 22 & he 21.. i can't believe he still care me as his crush even i didn't even knew.. \n\nI'm glad to be with you & i love you soo much..
Ed this is my favourite song. I love you so much! Come to chile 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱

This song reminds me (John legend-All of me) song!!!
"I love this song so much (well I love all his songs but this one is by far my favorite)! Its a perfect some for my husband and I! We have known each other since we were 14 & 15 and were best friends until we started dating when we were 17 & 18! We have been together now for 15 years, married 10 and have 2 beautiful children together! This song just expresses our love in a way that I would never be able to do! \n\nThank you Ed Sheeren for writing this touching and romantic song! I hope to see you in concert one day!"
