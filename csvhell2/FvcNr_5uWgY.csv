There is an entire sunrise in her smile.\nREPLY
"Jessie j fan girls, come here and comment!!!!"
When I was younger I loved Jessie J’s music no one else did j and I wondered why now I know this compared to 2010 wow Jessie
"Lord, bless you mama! Your voice! You, omg. You're absolutely gorgeous!! (though I know you won't see this) but MAN she's gorgeous!!"
My Gosh this woman is amazing <3

When she turned and mutter ' I love you' my heart just burst into a hundred million happy joy giddy feeling inside! So in love with this song and awe with her talent!
Yessssssssss!!!!! First of all serving us looks. Then you go and drop all of these flawless runs and belts. You left me with my jaw on the floor speechless 😶. But it’s just what I do expected from QUEEN JESSI J👸🏻!
This is so raw it's pure.
Her eyes.....her eyes tell a story....A very sad story....
"Amazing, I stop my eye from watering. You are not my ex."

She prepared for singing the same way as me. Funny how it can make you feel less alone.
This is really good. ..
she is SO beautiful
i wanna cry so bad! Forever have been a fan of this amazing voice for the exact same reason i love this song. #TotalLovefromthePacificIslandsJessie
"I heard she was going to quit singing, thank God she didn't"
She is pure beauty her voice is pure beauty the song and the lyrics are pure beauty everything about this video is pure beauty.
"Very original. I can relate to this song, love it... Love the simplicity of the video."
"Tell me the color of your pain. That's how my song in Azerbaijani starts. Must admit, if just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Azerbaijan (I guess you even don't know where this country is). I do know that folks always make these comments, but I believe that I will be the one you'll be excited you decided to listen to. If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that I don't suck and you won't be disappointed. I Just need one chance and 3 minutes."
