lol i dont get it..... someone explain....
"I honestly wasn't expecting this to be super good, even though I love Dodie's content.\n\nBut man, I got serious goosebumps before the music even started. That movement, man. Wow.\nAnd it carried all the way through, that quality. What a complicated and fantastically controlled feeling you've given me. Wonderful job. Heavy stuff."
"Not trying to rain on anyone's parade but I kind of just don't get this video... I found it quite overacted and the exposition of the protagonist was (imo) far too long in comparison to the about 20 seconds of Oh look, every beautiful girl in the world feels super insecure that I guess where the message of the video?"
God I love this.  And I feel like everyone out in the world feels this at one point.  Your all beautiful 😘
Dodie is so amazing and talented 💛💛💛💛
Holy wow this is so beautiful
I rate this song a 10/10.
I'm confused but intrigued
"I freaking love this song so much!!! When ever there are days when I feel low, I grab a pen and write a small 6/10 on my wrist. That way, I can unconsciously listen to the song in my mind to help me feel a little better. It's what gets me through the day :)"
dis ash bootiful video but i didn't get the hand motions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsowwy
It's okay. I didn't need my heart anyways
"thank you, dodie, for reminding me i'm not alone."
"OMG HER VOICE IS SO AMAZING I'M SO FED, I am a bit confused tho, what is she doing with he hands and stuff, it's really cool😂  (edit) oooo wait a sec OMG that make so much sense, it just hit me"
I am absolutely in love with this
WHY TF IS THIS SO SADDDD
"Hey dodie I love u, but spilling drinks on customers and looking miserable ain't gonna make that dollar"
"First line of the song, and I was hooked"
ya did it again didn't ya
your lyrics are just so beautiful and poetic. blew me away.
dodie where is the rest of the videos? I’m waiting
I give it a 6/10
"Today I auditioned for my school musical, Mary Poppins. It was originally going to be something else but 2 weeks ago it was changed. I've always wanted to be in a school play, but I'd been too nervous to try out. This year I'd gotten it in my head that I was going to be in the school musical, it was my dream and I wasn't going to let my insecurities put it off any longer. So about a month ago I went up to my school's drama teacher and told her that while I can't really sing, I'd really like to get a minor role with minimal singing and she seemed happy to accommodate me. \n\nBut then the musical was switched to Mary Poppins, a movie I'd watched many many times as a child. Now I still thought I couldn't sing, but I really wanted to try so for two weeks I practiced Chim chim Cher-ee I didn't actually think I could land such a huge role as Bert, more realistically I wanted one of the chimney sweeps for Step in Time but I thought why not, I'll practice both and just choose one on the day of the audition. \n\nSo today was the day and I got it in my head that I would sing Chim chim Cher-ee. They called my name and I went into the classroom, away from the buzzing noise of my far more talented classmates. The drama teacher said she knew I didn't want to sing and to just read these lines as best I could. I wanted to say that I'd been practicing a song and I wanted to sing but with 3 teachers glaring at me I was too nervous so I just butchered the lines and left as fast as possible. The second I left, I regretted it. I wanted to sing, I wanted it so much so I decided I would just wait until everyone else had auditioned (so that I didn't interrupt) and go back in to ask if I could sing. And so I waited for about an hour, and at some point my mom had texted me asking how much longer would I be, but I didn't answer because I was worried she would think I was dumb for waiting around. Then my mom walks up to me in the hallway and start asking me why I didn't answer her text and how much longer would it be. I took her off to the side and explained what happened, but it took so long to explain by the time I was done auditions were over. So my mom goes straight into the room where they held auditions and tells the drama teacher but I really wanted to sing embarrassing the crap out of me. The teacher was so sweet about the misunderstanding and gave me a chance, but by this point I was so embarrassed and nervous that I was crying. I try to pull myself together as quickly as possible because I really wanted this. I started singing but because I just been crying I got choked up after the chorus and couldn't (I was really disappointed in myself because my favorite part of that song is the ending). The teachers were really supportive of me singing and had already cast me as a couple minor roles. \n\nI just feel so worthless and dumb because I couldn't to get the part of that song that I thought I was actually kind of good at. As soon as I got home I saw this video had been released, and I have never seen or heard a piece of art that so perfectly reflected how I was currently feeling. Even if the teachers weren't the ones to make me feel like I wasn't good enough, I I feel so dumb that I screwed up not once but twice and I just wish that someone could hear me sing for real."
The allusions to La La Land. AAAAAH.
dodie may feel a 6/10 but i feel a -6/10
This is the best birthday present ever at the end I was so sad I want to hug dodie and tell her it's okay and that she is loved and apreciated
"Ok this is gorgeous and all, but on the days when i feel like a 6/10 it,s a high for me ,I get thrilled that i feel I'm over the half mark and higher than mediocre..."
"This song is so relatable, I love it so much. Amazing job and beautiful song 💕"
S H O O K\nyou're so pretty dodie<33
The choreography in this is amazing. Love how everything about this video communicates the self-consciousness we all feel intensely inside ourselves - and then shows that we all feel it.
Can someone explain to me the meaning of those gestures?
U are so pretty!!!!!! Just saying
"Im not gay but, you cant not be gay for Dodie"
Wow I'm in tears just. I'm speachless that was incredibly heart touching. incredible
"I feel like a six out of ten\nI gotta get up early tomorrow again\n\nWhat goes on behind the words?\nIs there pity for the plain girl?\n\nCan you see the panic inside?\nI'm making you uneasy, aren't I?\n\nWhat goes on behind the words?\nIs there pity for the plain girl?\nI'll close my mouth, I won't say a word\nA nod of pity for the plain girl.\n\nI know that you don't want me here [4x]\nI know that you\n\nOh, I'll just call a taxi,\nI gotta get up early tomorrow again.\n\n(Oh, I'll just call a taxi,)\n(I gotta get up early tomorrow again.)\n\nWhat goes on behind the words?\nIs there pity for the plain girl?\nI'll close my mouth, I won't say a word\nA nod of pity for the plain girl"
this is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen.
that was so beautiful i cried <3
this blows me away every time I see it
I love it! It is so authentically shown and made! Beautiful!!
"im sorry if i sound stupid, but i don’t understand this video? i love dodie a lot and i feel there was a really deep meaning in this that i just cannot find, can someone please explain? i love the vid tho!!"
i was watching this with the minecraft music in the background and it fit so well it took me a minute to notice
Could someone explain the shoulder grabbing part? I feel dumb for not getting it
it literally broke my heart seeing her crying at the end owie
"For anyone reading this who feels like a 6/10, I have something to tell you. I am not going to say all that bullshit about how you are worth it and deserving and beautiful and you should not feel like a 6/10 because me saying that won't do anything. There are plenty of other comments in the comments section to tell you that. What I am going to say is that it is okay. It is okay to feel like a 6/10 on certain days as long as you don't make it an everyday thing and make your mind completely believe that you are and will always be a 6/10 because you won't.  It is okay to feel like a 6/10 on some days but you also have to make sure that your mind knows that the real you is a 10/10 and the feeling of feeling 6/10 is just temporary. So don't try to suppress it but also don't let it overpower the real amazing 10/10 you."
I love this video but I don’t get What is wrong with their shoulders and neck the whole time?! Can someone explain?
why was she fideling  with her shoulders tho? I didn't get the refrence. Can someone explain it to me?
"Beautiful. We all strive and struggle, love it!"
"I just wanted the others to go after her. You are not alone. We all feel like that and no one deserves to be made to feel like that. We all feel like that at some point, we all want someone to recognise how we feel and help us; so why don't we? \nVery powerful video"
that shot of dodie coming down the stairs at the end is so goddamn beautiful and moving holy shit
