I like it bro.
was I the only one who wanted to see the ball drop at 2:20 and the other balloons to break too at 2:24
joderrrr the best song in the fuck vidaaa
I don't know why... but my ziam heart aches listening to this song...
Is no one going to talk about the stereotypical bad boy image this person shows. I'm lovin' It!
"FALSETTO HIGHER THAN MY GRADES, LIAM, WHAT THE HECK"
2:32 - 2:34 - 2:36\nThe voice at the back sounds like Zayn ;-;
This one is way better than Strip That Down!Way way way way way better
Ur voice sounds better than Zayn's nd Charlie Puth's...
I am so proud
I AM NOT OKAY AFTER LISTENING TO THIS SONG!!!
"I like this, for some reason this gives me a Drake vibe"
I need ziam's collab right now
This song has good vibes ❤️
Damn this song is good.
"You're reading this, Liam??\nI need you to collaborate with Zayn in future! No, I meant NEAR future!\nI'm calling for a petition for Ziam collaboration!! \nXOXO from Indonesia!"
Pure love from #INDIA 😍😍😍😍
"Oh my God this is so bad, what garbage. Yikes"
THAT HIGH NOTE KILLED ME😰😰😰😭😭
I got Notifications When He Said \nmy iPhone Rings
ALL THIS NEW MUSIC FROM THE 1D BOYS I CAN’T KEEP UP AHHHH
I LOVE the song but I thought Adam Levine was featured...Then I realized it was Liam just Liam. I never knew he could sing that high. Impressive 👌😇
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU BABY😍😍😍💕❤\nJUST GETTING STARTED 😍🙆💕❤ \nI LOVE YOUU!#
Please subs my channel! For more lyric video. Help me to build it up! Thank you so much
I broke my replay button \n\nFirst Louis\nSecond Niall\nThird Liam \nFourth Zayn\n And uh where is Harry's new song???\nYes of course Liam Payne do sound like Adam L from Maroon 5 and I'm in love with this new song and did a great job on this one and I am not ready what will the video be like!!!!
What is it with 1D and dirty laundry???
"Oh no, but this is gonna get so annoying to listen to because it’s quintessential pop: repetitive, unnecessary falsettos, and overwhelmingly shallow...just what the DJs love to play.\n\nI really liked “Strip That Down” and “Get Low” though."
Liam looks like the next David Beckham.
in love with this song after \ndusk till dawn \nim just like you \nflicker \nand \nbedroom floor 😍😍😍
Lyrics are quite  poor tbh like love everything but like iPhone iPhone........ Sounds like something someone would write in a 2000 song
Don't fucking say which phone k it's not fair
This song dropped on my birthday!!!!
"Just like you, How long, Flicker, and Bedroom floor in one week\nWhat the f*ck very amazing."
"Lyrics are meh, but I like the beat and melody of this"
"Sounds like windows in the beginning,  AHHAHAHAHAHAH like the song tho"
Am I the only one who thought it sounded like Maroon 5
"I love this , very catchy :)"
i'm so fucking obsessed
harry also has a new song so\n\nyea (just look up 'girl crush' its so good) it's a cover but stilll
the vid tho... so flippin' awesome.... they're all so damn talented
Written by Charlie Puth - and it is about a relationship between charlie and another girl
Why is he using autotune? He doesn't need it. Unfortunate that he's endorsing that.
How do I love you so much like I normally don’t like newer songs but yours 😍👍🏻👍🏻
Its just me or that flag is the same as Rita Ora’s YOUR SONG lyrics video
at first i didn't like it bUT THE BEAT AND THE BEDROOM FLOOR PART FUCKED ME UP

"wow. this song is really awesome. but, your clothes say different on my bedroom floor"
I LOVE YOU LIAM 😍😍😍

"When my iPhone rings😂😂😂😂😂,I think she is a gold digger😂😂😂😂"
